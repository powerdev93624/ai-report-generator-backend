\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mark Nabong  0:11  \
Hello, love you. Hello, hello, hey. How are you doing? Good man, how's it going\
\
Justin Newey Allen  0:16  \
doing? Well, sorry about that. I saw your meeting invites, and so I thought I didn't even open them. I thought, Oh, you just did that. That's great, because then I won't have to set up zoom or something else, yeah. And when I just barely like it at, you know, one minute before a call I went in, I was like, Oh, you created the thing. And I was supposed to do my job like I would, said I would. And so thank you for doing and\
\
Mark Nabong  0:44  \
again, the we didn't. When you're dealing with a large incidence against it, we don't expect quick turnaround on info. So how's it going today?\
\
Justin Newey Allen  0:55  \
I'm doing. Okay. How\
\
Mark Nabong  0:56  \
about you? I'm good. Are you in the office? So\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:00  \
I'm actually on BYU campus right now. Oh,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:06  \
that's really cool. That is, yeah, this will be interesting,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:10  \
because it looks like Mike or something, because I'm getting a delay, I think,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:19  \
is there? Okay,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:21  \
probably my end, because I'm just using the thing here. Let me see I test it.\
\
How's it for you? Are you getting a delay? I'm\
\
Mark Nabong  1:35  \
not getting a delay. So I can't remember what that means, like, if it's coming on your end or mine, if you want, I can try to my wife. I assume I am I am on my Wi Fi. If it becomes an issue, we can come back and and try again. So just keep me abreast of how, how hard it is to understand me and this call, okay,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  2:05  \
I think it might be worth looking at my speed. Says it's super fast, so maybe it is on your end, but I think it's actually a good test.\
\
Mark Nabong  2:13  \
Maybe it's me. I think\
\
Justin Newey Allen  2:18  \
this might happen in\
\
Mark Nabong  2:21  \
Yeah, let me do a, let me, let me take a, do a quick speed test to see what's going on with this.\
\
Oh yeah, what the heck that is. Crazy slow. It's like three megabytes per second, right? Hang on. I'm going to switch. I'm going to switch networks. Hang on. Well,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  2:45  \
and if we want to try it actually might be interesting for the transcript I was actually looking in addition to just re upping my zoom thing, I they're being called Riverside, that records on the both ends. So, oh, it records. It would record on your computer side and my computer side. So if there is a delay or something like that, it still picks that.\
\
Mark Nabong  3:14  \
That is an interesting that is an interesting option. I did. I did just switch Wi Fi, sorry, when you were saying that, maybe we should stay on it, I already switched. So it should be COVID at over 10 megabytes per second, not super fast, but hopefully Is there less\
\
Justin Newey Allen  3:30  \
there's not a delay. Now it's working great. Okay, okay, well, cool. And you've got your otter recording this. I've\
\
Mark Nabong  3:39  \
got auto recording this if there is a way, let me see if there's a way for me to press AI companion, we're going to test it. Let's see if I can get it to transcribe here at the let's see here one second, I just want to see how to request a transcription.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  4:11  \
Okay, we could even just if there's a way to turn on zooms\
\
from this one, we could even just, you could send me the audio file, and I could upload those. I'm going to record it on my end as well with with the audio recorder on my computer, and then plug that into a transcriber thing so we can get that but like, if we have your otter AI, either transcription or audio file. Yeah, I'll get the transcription, and then if we can do it on Zoom, that's great, but we don't necessarily need\
\
Mark Nabong  4:51  \
three Okay, let's see here. That sounds good. It should be recording. Now, are you getting the notice that we're recording?\
\
Justin Newey Allen  4:58  \
Yes, okay, oh, okay,\
\
Mark Nabong  5:04  \
that's cool. Yeah. So we've got zoom recording, we've got otter recording, and we've got your Riverside. Is that the new No,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  5:11  \
not Riverside yet. I'm just using the recording tool on my computer. Okay? And then I Well, when I said so, I was lazy, when I saw that, you said, the meeting invite, I was like, Oh, Mark, just must have set up his zoom. So we're good. I won't worry about, like, digging into whether I should go with Riverside or zoom. So I didn't, this is\
\
Mark Nabong  5:32  \
easy enough. Is easy enough. We, we've, we've already got it right, so\
\
Justin Newey Allen  5:39  \
we're covered. Well, maybe, and we'll do like, kind of like, the how you doing in part of the interview as well. So maybe I'll just okay, we'll or if you're ready to go, we can go ahead and start. Okay, all right, starting interview now. Great. Just wanted to do a pause. So Hey, Mark, thanks so much for making time. I am sure you are a very busy person, and so taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with me here is really, really helpful, and I'm excited to get to know you better on this call before we get started, let me just ask you received the email. Did you have any questions, or did you feel like you understand what this is about? Or would it be helpful for me to give you a brief overview about what we're doing here?\
\
Mark Nabong  6:27  \
I would appreciate a brief overview. I understood it, but you can always miss something. Yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  6:35  \
absolutely. So, you know, I have had the opportunity to work with leaders like yourself for the last 20 years. I've actually done a lot of work in the Middle East and kind of where you're at in Europe and other places around the world. And one of the things that we found to be extremely helpful is to give leaders an opportunity to have a conversation like this with me. I do a lot of executive coaching and leadership development to really get a sense of what you've found to be helpful so far in your career, and what are some things that you'd like to continue working on. So while as labeled, this is an assessment, I will be kind of, we're recording this as was mentioned in the email, and we're going to be taking a look at that transcript and creating a report for for the folks there in talent development at the same time. This is more than assessment. This is an opportunity for you to kind of reflect back on what's worked well for your career and think about what you'd like to continue working on going forward, and that's really how I hope you benefit from this, because I think, really, I wouldn't want to do this if you didn't feel like you were getting a benefit. So that's that's really what it's all about, and it'll help me. And then those who I'm providing the report to to better understand your leadership, experiences, opportunities for growth. We'll explore how you've demonstrated some of the key competencies that we're looking for during the course of your career, and I'll be asking you to provide some examples. So I'll be asking you to say, Hey, this is when I did this, or this is when I did that. And so what I would ask as we get going here is that, if you can try it and open as possible, just you know, share with me where, where you're coming from, and we have two full hours, it might seem like a lot. I most people I talk to actually say, go by quickly. I hope that's the case for you, but, but yeah, I think as we go through it, I would just say, kind of be as transparent and open as you can. That will help both you and also help me to better understand what what I'm going to do with this information. I mentioned the transcript. Nobody will see the transcript besides myself and my team outside of STC, those what I'll do is I'm going to put together a 10 page report, and in that report that will be shared with our colleagues there and in leader and talent development. And so I don't think at this point that that will necessarily be shared with you, though some organizations choose to share those eventually. So I hope that you can, and then I'll kind of digest it and think about it and put into that report. Did that help? Or you any other\
\
Mark Nabong  9:32  \
questions? No, that's great. Is that 10 pages about me?\
\
Justin Newey Allen  9:37  \
Good question. Yeah. So it's, it's, yeah, 10 pages. But a lot of it actually is about the competencies, which I'm going to get into in a moment. So when speaking actually with Olean, our CEO, and some of the other senior leaders, I had the opportunity to really get an understanding of what's happening next and here in the organization, and so that's, that's kind of what we're going to be looking at, is what are the skills needed to go forward? And I just need to push pause, because I might need to leave this room, and I think I've got somebody waiting outside, sure, so we're going to have to push pause here.\
\
Mark Nabong  10:16  \
Pause, pause. Sorry. I will keep talking to keep the recording active on my end. Okay, much like, much like the FCC doesn't like dead, dead radio air, I will, I will keep talking. Yep, I'll see\
\
Justin Newey Allen  10:33  \
if I can find another place.\
\
Mark Nabong  10:35  \
I will fill this with inane patter that will confuse the AI made chicken tacos tonight. They were quite delicious. It was unexpected that I made chicken tacos because the ground beef had actually expired, but the chicken tacos worked just fine. They worked amazingly well. So I was really pleased with how those chicken tacos turned out I am, I am located in the city of Barcelona, but I'm originally from Chicago. I was born in the Philippines, but we moved to Chicago when I was one. I spent most of my life there, until until college, where I actually stayed in the city college, college for a couple of years. Lived there for three years, back Chicago for a year or so, and then went to law school in DC, Washington, DC, stayed for three years, met my now wife, started dating her when we were in law school. We moved to Chicago after law school. She's from Texas originally, and we lived in Chicago from 1007 through our marriage and the birth of two children up until 2021 and in 2021 we moved to Barcelona. So now I have been in Barcelona in Spain. Went for the last three and a half years, which is very surprising to say out loud that I've been three and a half years, three and a half years when I was younger, felt like such a long\
\
It feels pretty short. You know, I guess part of being 46 is that the the years, as you run out of years, they also seem less less this large year seems for even though I've got fewer of them left. So the we have been here for three and a half years. My kids now speak Spanish. My wife and I do not as well as the kids, but, but we're doing okay, and this year, we applied for myself and the two children, we applied for citizenship here in Spain, and I just received my I gave my received word at the end of 2024 that my application was accepted, and I took the Oath of Citizenship and of nationality, and hopefully I will be able to pick up the transcript of that oath, the the notarized transcript of that oath, and use that to go get my passport and birth certificate, which is a Very\
\
Justin Newey Allen  14:00  \
I am super impressed that you were talking now.\
\
Mark Nabong  14:04  \
You'd be surprised how much inane travel I can feel if necessary. I I've said that I've never been in a job where filibustering was required, because I would have been fantastic at filibustering. I could have talked about nothing for years.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  14:23  \
Well, I thought that so it's a Friday afternoon. I had a meeting with a professor here at BYU. I thought, oh, grab one of the many, many break rooms. But this place is, don't know what's wrong with BYU students, but they're all studying on\
\
Mark Nabong  14:36  \
a Friday afternoon exams at the end of January and on some schools.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  14:40  \
No, it's like, that's why I thought there's nothing. There's no midterms. It's just like everybody is going crazy studying at 2pm on a Friday.\
\
Mark Nabong  14:49  \
But, you know, I, I, I've talked about this with a few friends, like when I was in college. I mean, it's always hard to get into colleges, right? But, like, the competition to get into universities now is crazy, like schools that used to be safety schools are like difficult to get into now, and I'm not sure exactly what the cause of that is, but I think that means that at a lot of schools now, the alphaness, the type aness of the students, I suspect, has gone up because they, all, you know, broke their backs trying to get in to the university, and I think a greater percentage of them, like, carried that into the way they approach university life.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  15:31  \
I that must be the case, because I got in here, like, I just ran over from the other building and and I was like, Oh, I can probably find a room, and I did find one, but anyway, she already had it reserved. So my bad. Well,\
\
Mark Nabong  15:46  \
I love the idea of you walking through, like the university's library, like yelling at the children, go outside. Go have fun. Go get a pizza with your friends.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  15:56  \
Well, maybe that's it. It's like, it's probably looking it's, I don't have the temperature on my phone right now, but it's probably like 10 degrees outside. So that's, it might also be\
\
Mark Nabong  16:06  \
that might it's, it's cheaper to heat the it's cheaper to sit in a heated library than to heat your apartment.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  16:13  \
That's right, all right. Well, back to it. So back to it. Yeah, and actually it's funny, I hadn't done a lot to prepare for that intro, and I feel like there are lots of things I'd want to fix. So this is good, because doing this in recording is going to help me think about what I want to do better, especially like what I say about that report. So you were saying a 10 page report that's all about me? Yeah, and that's actually a good place for me to say. So I don't know this is good, because I'm getting more prepared. I'll just so let's kind of like, I'm going to say the word start, start, start, start. So it's on the transcript. Now we're starting. Let's just keep going. So yeah, the 10 page 10 page report is going to have a list of different competencies, which we'll talk about in a minute, and it'll have kind of the experiences, or brief summaries of the experiences that you share with me about how you have demonstrated those competencies over time.\
\
Mark Nabong  17:19  \
That makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. This is it's very interesting. I've never talked about myself for two hours in a row before. That is me saying, what a potential client would say. I 100% have talked about myself for two hours in a row. I probably did it today. So,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  17:40  \
yeah, well, that's great. And I was gonna ask you, have you done like an assessment like this before? I know, in your organization, you guys do a lot of different kinds of assessments.\
\
Mark Nabong  17:51  \
I have done a Myers Brigg in the past. I'm gonna be I'm gonna confess I don't remember what my what my horoscope was at the end of that. So,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  18:07  \
all right, well, this is, I mean, in some ways, this is, I guess, somewhat similar. The good thing about this, compared to a Myers Briggs, is in Myers Briggs, or other kind of survey assessments, we're asked to kind of give a score or pick one versus another, you know, you'd say, Oh, I'm this out of five, or I prefer this over this, right? And I think what I love about these interpersonal or what we call, um, qualitative discussions, qualitative conversation assessments, is that you can have a chance to explain yourself when it's like a Myers, like at the mercy of the dots that you pick, and there's no context or color, which I think is so and so I really invite you to help me understand, because the better you help me understand, the better context I have. And it won't just be black and white, it'll be a full palette of colors about who mark is and all of the awesome things that you do. Yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  19:06  \
I mean that that sounds great. Okay, well,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  19:10  \
then let's go ahead and get started. And by the way, well before we get started, I saw like in your in your CV, that you got a law degree, and it looks like it was from a school in the DC area. Is that, am I reading that? Right?\
\
Mark Nabong  19:25  \
That's right. That's right. I got my my law degree at Georgetown in DC. Okay,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  19:30  \
yeah, tell me about that. What was that like for you? I mean, just, I know this is not like, kind of what we're doing here. I'm just, that's pretty cool.\
\
Mark Nabong  19:37  \
It was great. I I I honestly love law school. I also met my wife there, so that's probably the most important output of my years there. But even leaving aside my own, my own personal happiness, it was really good. I had gone. I had gone to grad school in paleontology, in evolutionary biology, which is great, and I loved it. I still love the subject matter, but it was not, it was not a good place for me in terms of my career, because the I'm kind of a city person, and I saw people much smarter than me go to wherever there was a university, you know, tenure track job to go to. And so after, after some reconsideration and some you know, soul searching, decided to leave grad school, went back to Chicago for a bit, and then went to law school. So for me, law school was, I told you that background, because law school was an attempt for me to be both intellectually engaged and also put myself on a career path and a life path that would be more in tune with the way I wanted to live. So law school was great for that. Every every job, everyone wants, like, five or six things from their job, right? They want money, they want it to align with their values. They want to have autonomy and feel like they can make a difference. They want it to align with their lifestyle. And they want they want something that they can be proud of, and their family to be proud of. And no one job does all of those things. And what was valuable for law school for me was it allowed me a greater range of possibilities than I would have had otherwise, in terms of assembling a career afterwards. And so that's, you know, that's how I ended up there.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  21:32  \
That's fabulous. And actually, you just touched on a lot of the things I was hoping we could talk about. So maybe we'll just even dig in there. But before, before we do that, I just want to tell you, hey, way to go. Because I, you know, it's I found, as I've worked with a ton of leaders around the world, it's, it's very easy times for people to get into a space like you were, it sounds like you were with paleontology, and then just stay there, even though maybe they've they're not completely satisfied with where they're at. So I just have to say, I'm very just from the get go here, that you were willing to make that jump, and I know that. I mean, taking the LSAT, getting the law school is not easy, especially at a place like Jordan. So super impressed. Thanks for Thanks for sharing that with me. Well,\
\
Mark Nabong  22:16  \
thank you. I don't know if it's impressed. I don't know I would be impressed with me, but I'm glad that I made the choices that I made. That's\
\
Justin Newey Allen  22:24  \
cool. Well, I mean, let's actually, let's go back. So I want to hear tell to you, you mentioned Chicago. Is that where you grew up? I did. I grew up in Chicago. Okay, cool. And so what was your Tell me? I mean, you know, we don't need, like, a ton of detail here, but I'm just curious about when you were growing up in Chicago. What was it like when you were kind of married? What, how did you spend your time? What did you do? Like, what was your favorite class? Just tell me a little bit about I just kind of want to get to know you. Like, who was the sure 1517, year old mark?\
\
Mark Nabong  22:57  \
Uh, I don't know that he knew, and I don't know that. I know, I think when you when you're in high school, I'll talk about me, and we'll make this general, when you're in high school, your clay. And one of the strange parts about being that age and that phase of life is you're constantly reshaping your own clay because you haven't fired it yet, right? You haven't put it in the kiln. And so you, you know, high school Mark was probably, you know, a nerd who who studied a lot and was in Academic Bowl, but high school Mark was also a varsity wrestler and and, You know, I also played, I played Dungeons and Dragons, like I with friends, which is, I think hopefully everyone does and everyone can, but you all of those facets, like become you're kind of a different person than each one of those. You're still you, but mark of high school is, for me, was constantly trying on personalities, constantly trying on, you know, honestly, you know, my approach towards what I would now call philosophy or morality, but at the time, just trying to figure out what I believed in and what, what the principles I had were. And so teenage Mark was the right mix of certainty and uncertainty and unearned self confidence and yet tremendous self doubt that I think is probably somewhat common to a lot of teenagers. So I think that the one thing that I'll say that might be interesting is that I grew up in a very ethnically and culturally diverse area in Skokie, Illinois, and that's one of my high schools in Stokey. And one of the features of high school Mark was, at the time, I didn't have a strong, strong sense of of difference between people. I mean, you knew, like, who you knew who your Jewish friends were, you know, your Muslim friends were. But at the time, I don't think I clocked to how deep those differences can feel for people later on in life. And so I one thing I am really thankful for is that my parents had us in that community and raised us around, you know, other, other good kids. And so that the thing that I've been able to carry, I hope, is I can always think back to that as you get older, and the world wants you to lithify and it wants you to solidify yourself, it's nice to go back to that more uncertain time where the differences between people was much smaller than the differences between myself for Monday and Tuesday.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  26:03  \
That's fascinating and and thank you for sharing that. Thanks for being so open. Because I agree. I think all of us in our formative years and even still today, right, right now, right we're kind of, we're still trying to figure out who we are and kind of what what we understand and know, and how we're going to interact with the world around us. I love that you had some of those formative experiences. I did. You know, we all face challenges and struggles at different points in our life. Did you feel like, were there any kind of major challenges that you feel like this was a hard thing, and then kind of how you worked through it, whether it was, it doesn't have to be monumental, but something that is there something that happened during those formative years, before you turned 20 or so that you were just like, wow, here's big thing for me,\
\
Mark Nabong  26:48  \
yeah, and I only have the language to describe it recently, but at the at the time, I had a problem with being able to just sit and work right, how to concentrate, how to get my work done. I was a, I don't know if you'd say that I was an intelligent kid, but I tested really well. I tested incredibly well, but my grades did not reflect it, or at least they didn't line up with it, in part because my own inability to what I said at the time, manage time. My own inability to to get things done on time or at high quality was was rough, and now I had a language to look back and say, I have a CHD. That's why I couldn't sit and concentrate, and it's why I like the normal study tricks that I tried to pick up from my parents or family members and friends didn't work. But I think the struggle was that the noise and studying when we working wasn't working for me. And I think there were a couple of times where I could have just put my hands up and said, like, I'm a bad student. Yeah. Like, what are you gonna do? I'm bad student. Throw me. Throw me in the ash can of people that showed a lot of promise, but did nothing with it. And one thing I am proud about, I'm saying proud, not for me, but for me and the support network, is that we found a way to build techniques. I found a way to build techniques that work for me. So to give you one example, to give some color to this, I don't know the way we'll typically study to go to the library or they sit down at their desk and they does work for me. I need a lot of distraction. My brain is like a three year old that needs to be constantly distracted by things so that the active part of my brain can concentrate. So sitting in a quiet room was the death knell for my productivity. I did learn that if I had a TV on or music on or both,\
\
it helped distract the non working part of my brain so that I could study, so that I could write. And it's one of those things that when you the reason I mention this is there are techniques you will adopt for survival, for effectiveness, for efficiency, that are not written anywhere. They're not written in any book. They're not written in any guide, but at least they weren't at the time. Sure, at the time you just have to, like you have to just trust your pole star and say, Okay, I need this to work. I empirically know that when I do this, I work hard, and when I don't, I don't work hard and just lean into it and accept it. And that took a while. It took well, in part because there is a strong difference, a large difference, between what looks like effective work and what is effective work, at least with this particular set of conditions that I have. So I could either choose to look like I'm working, which is when I sit with a book head in my mouth, but I'm actually doing nothing. I'm actually thinking about nothing, yeah, or put on headphones, put a TV on in the background and stare at a blank piece of paper or stare at the book for a few minutes, which does not look like work to anyone else, but I know that I'm processing what I'm reading and or I am mentally reviewing what I just read and coming up with my own thoughts on it. And I think that is the main story. I guess I'll tell you, out of your question, which is that, you know, at a younger age, I came up with, and again, this is not the language I would have used back then. That's language I have now. Yeah, I came up with a way to make a faulty bit of machinery that is my brain work, right? Like, sometimes, you know, sometimes you can, you can get them in a working car, and sometimes you have to duct tape a whole bunch of bicycles together and, and in this case, like, I have to duct tape a whole bunch of bicycles together and just accept that it's not going to look like effective transportation to anyone else.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  31:08  \
Wow, that. So thank you for sharing that, because that will help me think about things going forward, and it actually ties to where we're going next. Okay, as I mentioned this, this report that I'm going to put together. It's based around these competencies, and I'm just going to share my slide real quick with you to share this model. Let me see if it let me know when you can see this. Can you can you see this slide here?\
\
Mark Nabong  31:33  \
It's loading right now, not quite yet. There it is. I can see it.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  31:37  \
Okay, great. So one of the things that oleon, our CEO, and others are really keen to figure out is, how do we ensure that here we have the best leaders now, but the best leaders like, what are we going to need to know do and be in the future, and how do we help bring all of us to that future? Because, as we know, just from the last several years, it seems like every six months or so, there's some crazy new thing that's so called unprecedented, right? It's like, wow, right? This is thing that never happened before. So when in working with oleon and with the team, and then also, we do a lot of this kind of work, and so we have a lot of research. We've gone through what's happening in your industry and what's going on around the world, and we've also looked at what we find the very best leaders doing in the past, and combine that with what we heard from your senior leadership team. And we built this model. We call it the star model, and it's an acronym for a strategic partner, talent, enabler, agile, executor and resilient steward. So S, T, A and R. And the idea here is that as leaders at STC, as you all exemplify and develop these types of skills or build on your strengths. If there are already strengths that you have then, then you'll be more prepared and better able to step into roles of greater responsibility. So what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to ask you some questions about your career, and I'm going to share examples with me that will help me kind of understand where you have interacted with these types of attributes in the past. Now, you don't need to know this model, or feel like, oh, I need to understand every single bit of this. So I'll just ask the questions. But I wanted to give you kind of this is the framework that I'm kind of basing it all on. And just to get a little bit more granular here, I'll show you this slide. So within each one of these four categories, the four star categories, if you can see that there, we've got a couple of things. So like in strategic partner, we're looking for individuals to be innovative, to connect, or partnership Well, or to figure out how to simplify things from all of the complexity and talent enabler we're trying to help individuals think about how they can continue to coach, empower teams, and really hold teams accountable to elevate performance. In the Agile exec here, it builds on that and says, how do we then deliver results on a regular basis? How do we adapt to the changing environment and then try new things through pioneering new efforts, and whether they're brand new or just new in our region and area, and then resilient steward. This has to do is really interesting, but has to do with this idea of understanding who we are, which is something you've kind of talked about, and then figuring out how we can best serve, inspire, and then ensure resilience and sustaining the results and the approach that we're getting, just not for ourselves, but for everybody. So I'm going to ask you some questions about your career, focused on if that any questions about this model before I dive into some of those questions.\
\
Mark Nabong  35:01  \
No, it's a lot to take in, but it's a, it's a pretty interesting model. I mean, definitely shows, I think, of, you know, managers and leaders that have been great, that I think it was like my favorites, and they definitely have traits that show up in this, in this model. Okay,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  35:17  \
cool. Well, good. Well, um, with that in mind, then if you can just give me a, I don't even know, 30 seconds, but like a 32nd to one minute hit by hit, rundown of your work experience, like kind of job to job to job. I don't need to know any details yet. So this isn't where you kind of describe spaces, but just like where you started and maybe starting, well, yeah, starting out after your undergraduate, because I know you had those graduate education experiences, but maybe starting with your under when you graduate from undergrad, then what happened from there?\
\
Mark Nabong  35:53  \
So when I graduated from undergrad, I was very much in the evolutionary biology space I introduced with the Smithsonian and and wrote my my Bachelor's paper on on print parenting behavior in old school mice. And so when I went to grad school, yeah, which is, which is much more interesting than it sounds on the surface, but interesting from there, I went to grad school, where kind of spent the first year trying to figure out who my advisor would be and who my what my focus would be, ended up becoming a focus on wooly mammoth evolution. My advisor was one of the foremost experts on it, and from there, after what we talked about before, you know, realizing that grad school wasn't for me, I ended up going to drove a cab for about a year as I was in Ann Arbor, trying to figure out what to do. At the time, I was dating a girl as well, and you're trying to figure out, like, what's my what's my future here? And during the course of that year, it said, like, you know, it's not working for me here. I need to be into back in a city, not that the city is the South that heals all wounds, but I was much more likely to be effective and to have good mental health if I was in a high density metropolitan area. So I moved back to Chicago and spent the time applying to law school. When I wasn't working, I was working selling junk mail for mortgage and finance company. So if you ever received a letter in the mail that said, like, you may have qualified for our lowest interest rate, yeah, that was me. And yeah, it was, it was, it was great, because I'd sell, like, 10,000 pieces of junk mail, and then I would recycle a little slip of paper that I wrote it down on. I'm like, Am I really? Am I really recycling if I generated 10,000 pieces of junk mail, but, but then went to law school, got into law schools, and and whatever.\
\
I was very happy about i I'll tell one little quip, which might be helpful for this evaluation. I've never gotten into my least for my undergraduate and my law degrees, I never attended a school that I came into without being on the wait list. So I was wait listed in college and wait listed in in law school, and thought I was going to school at Notre Dame in Indiana, and then got in off the wait list in in law school, I tell you, that's as a vehicle so I can tell this quick story. I tend to try to be funny in my essays as a way to stand out. And also it's it's my own. It's my one way of interacting with the world. And in my first year of law school, I was speaking to one of the admissions officers there, Sophia, we are, you know, having a drink, as one does, like, in, like, the central law school. And I said, my name. She said, oh, oh, I know you. I read your, I read your, your application as one of the folks reading. I was like, Oh, that's great. Thank you for for the admission. She said, Yeah, so there's two types of wait list. There's wait list a and wait list B. I said, I, I don't know where this is going, but okay. And she said, most, almost every person who's admitted off the wait list is in wait list a. So wait list A are the students that you know are there, and we could easily swap them out, like if, if we if people don't matriculate, weightless B is a relatively larger pool, but it really dip into weightless B if something unusual happens, like a scandal involving the school in the news where suddenly, like, the numbers go down, or an unexpected tuition hike that causes the number, the number of people matriculating to go down, so we almost never dip in weightless B. And I said, I, I'm, I'm curious as to why you're telling me. And she said, Well, you're in weightless B. I'm like, clearly 1% that's where you're going with the story said you're in weightless B. And the one of the things that stood out for us is you sent your original essays, and they were really funny, and then when you we told you you're on the wait list, you're given the opportunity to add more detail. And you sent three or four other essays, which were hilarious. And Dean kornblad, the dean of admissions, read these essays and looked at him on the table and said, You know what, we've got space. He'll be good for morale, and that's how you were given admission. And I said, Well, I'm going to take this as a win. I choose to accept this as a win. Thank you, Sophia. So this is not just me trying to be funny, but also when you ask about like my career path, I think this is relatively important, because I have had a number of and professional\
\
interests is that I sometimes find myself in positions where you need to defend maybe that's more aggressive word, but you need to establish your value to gatekeepers. And I think you know, after law school, I worked for legal aid in the domestic violence division where we, we, we represented the victims of domestic violence or their children. And after being there for a number of years, which was, as you can imagine, quite heavy on the psyche, my wife and I decided that, you know, we, we wanted to do something else, you need to do something else. And I had been up for a job with the State Department, which fell through eventually, but we went through the whole two years of background check or pass the back project, but still the job didn't materialize in the end, but it kind of what our appetite we're working with season doing something, something different than what I've been doing. And that's when the idea to go into infrastructure came in. So work for telecom industry, for wants to pay cut to work in telecom, but I wanted to get out of family law, divorce law, because I was working for a small I left out. I was working for a for profit Law Firm for a short period of time, but decided that for a number of reasons, it wasn't a good fit. So went into infrastructure work and built cell towers, and for the most adults, sometimes antennas, and went west Texas, New York City, North Dakota, kind of all over the place, and then got a job at Tesla, kind of doing the same thing, but instead of for cell towers, it was charging stations, super charging stations. So I believe you said earlier you live in Utah, if you've ever driven through the Dakota or or Montana, I'm sorry, Minnesota, where the Dakotas in a Tesla probably stopped at a development that I spearheaded, and then, after a number of layoffs at Tesla, due in part to the the lack of production of their model three, we don't need to go into all this. Ended up getting a job as an as a lobbyist and attorney for an environmental group called the Natural Resources Defense Council, and worked there for a couple of years. And then, and this should be the penultimate stop on our on our ridiculous ride, was talking to a friend who I had been working with on some solar development projects and wind development projects for a number of years on the side, which NRDC approved. They they reviewed what I did. They said, that's fine, just don't, don't build in any states where you have a lobbying lobbyist. So talking to a friend about it, and said, like, I'm pretty sure energy is going to want to blow up. I'm wondering if I should switch careers and move into moving into it. Do you know anyone who's hiring? Why don't we just when just come work with us and we'll keep doing what we do, just have you do it full time instead of, like, a couple hours a week, I said, Great. So that was in 2020, and that's when I started working in development. And to polish off the story, here's the ultimate portion of it. Been working there in that field or adjacent projects since then, as a consultant and developer, and still had the bug in our bonnet about wanting to try to live overseas, and thought, Well, how do I make myself? They look at my resume. Nothing here says this guy wants to live overseas. This guy works on international projects, so got the idea to look for either a degree program, certificate that would give that global, you know, international look, and that's how I ended up at as you know, since you talked before at Harvard for The global development practice program, and that's what brought me here.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  45:44  \
Very cool. What a fun ride. And I'm sure it's a ride, yeah, well, and I, I'm glad we have another hour and 15 minutes, because I want to hear all about it. I Justin, so it's very intriguing. And I, I think this would probably be a good time I shared that that model with you. It, yeah, let's jump in. So in strategic partner that the s of the Star model, there are three things, innovate, connect and simplify, and I've already heard you talk around several of those. But let's jump into the Innovate one and back even your the example you gave about as a high school or how you were you found solutions, given your set of circumstances and resources to solve. Can you can you share an example from any one of those stops along your work experience of where you challenge the status quo, you developed and then implemented something unique or different, innovative, something like that.\
\
Mark Nabong  46:53  \
So I'll give you two, and I don't know if either of these answer, but you'll tell me if they answer them, one is the reason why I left Legal Aid and worked for that for profit. Law Firm was a was the opportunity to start the family law practice that law firm had never had a family law practice, where they did a criminal law practice and an immigration law practice, never had a family law practice, and some of their clients said all these things kind of fit together in your life. And so it was an opportunity to start a family law so I had to do hiring and select the staff and build it up. So to the extent that that is innovative like that is an innovation where you're trying to bring a process to a company that's never had it before. But I also think that that's not quite answering the question, because it seems that the question is also asking, Where did you have to buck a trend? Part of innovation is having to fight against an entrenched interest, and there I'm parachuted in. Here is a firm that is happy to have a family law practice. You are stepping on nobody's toes. Nobody is harmed unless it's like there's a queue at the copier for you doing your work. And so I think a part of innovation is not just coming up with new ideas, making them happen, but coming up with a new idea and being able to defend and or modify it in the wake of stakeholder opposition and in a way that hopefully you're able to get everybody on board where you're not winning, everybody's winning, right? Like that's the goal is, is innovation isn't even though it is in the face of someone else's process. You don't want that person or persons to feel like it's a negative development on them. And so what I'll argue is that when I was in telecom, one of the things that we we we had a process for how we, you know, develop projects and how we account for them. And it was important to me at the time that instead of just running the numbers, if we had to get this many permits out, we have to review this many construction drawings, it was important that we were able to take accountability for it. And unfortunately, at the time, it was run a little bit like a factory where there was a shared email address, where everybody, I'm sorry, there was not a shared email address for everybody. Everybody had their email address, but then no one was in charge of making sure that the emails were being responded to, and because of turnover, or because of the growth of the company, people being promoted to other positions, permits or responses were falling behind and and so One of the things I came up with was we need we can't have individual we can't apply under individual emails. We have to have individual emails. But all submissions for permits need to be under permits@mobility.com or whatever it was, and and we need to make sure that there is an assigned person who is checking these at all times, and that the burden of the administration of that has to be spread out amongst other people. It can't just be Mark, this is your job, but you're being evaluated on the number of permits you get out, the number of cell towers you get built. So it has to be one that can that is spaced around and is given credit at review process, at review time. And so I think that is one in which there was enough a lot of pushback, because the pushback was that it would slow people down right when, anytime you have that, it puts it out there, and also it put a number of people submission under the microscope. So if you have a terrible submission, right, and the administrator of the city or the state comes back and says, like, what the heck is this? You know, there's almost all kinds of things, whereas before, there was no one except your direct supervisor who would possibly find out about that. But even then, the supervisor may not see it, it will just go into your email, and you could ignore it and say, oh, sorry, permit was denied. We'll have to reapply. No one asks question. There's no QA but because of that, a number of people who may have emphasized quality, quantity over quality, were in opposition and took heat on it, and I think that's a situation in which these are friends too.\
\
Leadership is working with the folks that you're innovating with, but also finding the ability and the willingness to weather on discomfort an uncomfortable situation, so that the processes themselves can improve. So\
\
Justin Newey Allen  51:56  \
great, great story and very fascinating example. What so what was the fallout? So, like, six months, 1012, months, a couple years after that, what happened? I'm really\
\
Mark Nabong  52:08  \
curious. Well, well, one, one of the managers got fired. He was just, it's like putting bubble gum in the box. We'll just count this as shift, and we'll figure out what we shipped later on. So and it wasn't just my innovations, but it was that combined with a number of others other issues, but I think it did help, because the ability,\
\
the best way it helped that was unforeseen was we were then able to hand off projects much more easily. It wasn't just that there was accountability or that the stuff would be replied to in a more timely manner, which is the main reason, but also it meant that when people moved to other jobs, or when regions had to be consolidated, okay, Mark, you're in charge of New Jersey now. Rebecca, now you're in charge of New Jersey and Connecticut. Well, now you're not looking for, you know, what did Mark do? What did Rebecca do? It's one email inbox. We've all got access to it. Go find out what's in there. And I think that was, I think that was a part of it, is it made the meta process of rearrangement within the company a lot easier. Cool.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  53:24  \
I love it. So let's you know, and what you'll see as I go through these elements of the model, they all interact and kind of correlate with each other. So the next one's very close, going from innovation.\
\
So connecting, partnering, building relationships. I'd love to hear. And again, you can pick a story from any one of you know, anywhere in your experience. But can you share a time with me where you were able to really reach out and build relationships? And I would particularly be interested on a story of when maybe it was, there was a pre existing difficult relationship, or there was barrier to building relationship, and you were able to then kind of work your way through that and build some strong relationships.\
\
Mark Nabong  54:15  \
Yeah, I've got one. I hope it's, I hope it's not too strange. Is when I was a divorce lawyer, you know, the when you are in any kind of contentious legal action activity, building bridges is incredibly hard, because part of the adversarial system is to smash the bridges right in a way you are ethically required to be a zealous advocate, and that means that sometimes you carry a Hammer around, and not a building hammer, but like a breaking hammer, right? In terms of relationships, which is fine, right? Especially given the nature, you know, the the abusive nature of some of these relationships I was in, like it was, he was part of my job to take the heat, right, so that my client didn't have to, you know, didn't have to, but, but, yeah, it is hard, and I think that it's also maybe non nonsensically a problem, especially when there are kids involved. And that when you have families that are divorcing or splitting apart, the ability to work for the sake of the kids is really important, and you're also trying to come up with an agreement, when the two parties are at the most adversarial, they're going to be the hurt of the split up. Maybe is still raw. The maybe they're still living together. Maybe they're not living together, but someone's living in their mom's garage, right? Like it's the odds of it being very, very stressful are through the roof. And so what the parts of connection that I think is important is trying to remind people, whether implicitly or explicitly about their shared humanity, right? Like you may not like this or you may never like this person again, but these children are gonna have to be in your lives for a bit. How do we make this work? And I'm gonna tell you a trick I use, and I'll say it's a trick. I think there's good scientific backing for it, but whenever I had a negotiation, as long as there wasn't a risk of physical abuse, if it's physical abuse, that's different, like we got to keep people separate, right? But as long as there's not that, one of the tricks I had is when you'd have to have a negotiation conference with the other attorney and yourself two parties. I would always order food, warm food, and leave it in the negotiation. With it. When we were negotiating, I tried to have it in my office, and preferably a food that, like you have to break apart, garlic bread, you know, just a loaf of bread that you got to break apart, some other kinds of food that require you to interact with someone else, and the parties all be sitting there, and my paralegal will be sitting there, or one of my assistants, my law student. And before we start, I'll say, Would everyone mind I have to go after the bathroom to get a cup of coffee. I need to call my family for a minute, and then I'll leave for 10 minutes, and I'll say, I apologize, you know, please, please bear with me. Leave for 10 minutes, and eight out of 10 times, someone, including my paralegal, because I usually plant them to do it, will start passing food around while we wait, we'll start handing food around while we wait, and even if they don't talk, because everyone again, tensions are high, even if they don't talk, the act of sharing a human connection, even with someone you hate, passing them food. Being passed food to them helps. Putting some food in their stomach helps and the fact that we, being one of the attorneys, is not coming in guns blazing, also changes it too, because there is a an incentive for attorneys, particularly in family law cases, to come in and look like the most aggressive people that I'm your Bulldog, I'm going to fight for you the two kids involved, right? You don't want a bulldog in the same room as an aggressive Bulldog in same room as kids. And so that is, I think, one way in which we have had to build bridges, even if they're going to fight forever about the IRA or about the retirement for a 1k account, if we can get to the point where enough shared humanity is there where their regard for their kids, or at least their feigned regard for their kids, because a lot of narcissists out there, but you need them to at least feel like they have to pretend to be a COVID parent and and it's that shared humanity that gets everyone a little closer to that page.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  58:43  \
So powerful. That was a great example. Thank you for sharing. And actually, I've learned something here, so I'm gonna, if you don't mind, I might take that trick and use it if I'm ever\
\
Mark Nabong  58:52  \
in this you should, you should, you should, you should always use it like feed. Feed people ahead of time. Yeah, every negotiation goes better. Yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  59:00  \
when I love that, you would get up and go, How did you figure that out? Like, what was that obvious to you? Or did that just happen serendipitously once? Or how did you figure out that idea of, like, stepping away and letting them do that without you in the room?\
\
Mark Nabong  59:14  \
Um, I found that it was a little bit more organic. Because if I'm sitting there, like, everyone knows that I'm an attorney, and it's my office. So if I'm sitting there and I'm like, handing people food, yeah, no one's hackles comes down because they're like, we're working. We're in the room. Every every party member needed is present, so we're working, right? And so when people are working, their hackles are up. But if people don't know the game is started, If people don't know the whistles blown.\
\
They're not\
\
that's what I needed, both the parties and honestly, the attorneys, to not believe that the game has started yet. Okay? Now, a savvy attorney will know that the game has started, yeah, but the parties won't, and and even if they do, Hey, man, there's free garlic dots. Like, what you know? What you know, what are you gonna get to say no to garlic knots, come on and and so that's where it was. You need at least one element to be missing to feel like an organic interaction, because otherwise it looks like a play. But if I'm not there, if the director is not there, the odds of it feeling like a play or lower.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:00:39  \
That is so interesting. So going, you know, kind of think about this connection idea, and it doesn't need to be as detailed as that one. But like, Do you have a way that you've been able to connect? I know that, like when you talked about the development work you've been doing, the more recent work or doing before, can you just touch on how you, how you go about building partnerships when maybe one doesn't exist, like reaching out and saying, Hey, we've got a we've, you know, we need to get working together. So initiating a partnership. I\
\
Mark Nabong  1:01:13  \
mean, I think, you know, it's soft sales 101, in a way, where I can wait to if you're good, sorry. I\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:01:20  \
just want to make sure that there wasn't somebody who had reached who had reserved this room, right?\
\
Mark Nabong  1:01:25  \
The it's soft sales, right? Where, you know, you have to be honest. Hey, look like, if I'm, if I'm a developer, look, I'm calling on behalf of mobility. We want to develop the we need. We need a cell tower that we need to sell antenna there. Part of it is that, right, just being honest, because people don't want a bait and switch, you really lose credibility if people find out eight minutes later it's a sales call, right? Or negotiation call, they need to be told up front. But the other part of it is, I think, when you're trying to, like, make a connection, and this is hard for you, right for me right now, because my part of my job is I gotta answer you right as part of this position, but normally I'd ask you to talk about yourself a lot more, because you ideally, in any of those bridge building conversations, I would should be listening about twice as much as I speak, because I you don't learn when you're speaking. You only learn about someone there's talking, and as I'm getting you find out the course of this work today, when people are allowed to explain themselves or express their feelings, their their guard goes down, and their ability, to be honest, is there, do you\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:02:43  \
need to move? There's a window to this room. I apologize. I keep looking up. There's just like a huge crowd of students, and I was, I was nervous that they were patiently waiting for me to leave the room. But we're gone now, so I think we're good period.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:02:56  \
Okay? So I mean, if there's, if there's mob outside, or a boycott, or some kind of military action. Please feel free to let me know, and we can, we can change it, but the but the that connection is partly from listening. Speaking is important, right? But the best speakers are the best listeners because they've already listened to what needs and thought about what needs to be said. And I think that that's the big part of the connection, if I'm I there was one call I had with Yolanda, the Department of Finance of New York City. I called up because we needed a permit, because you're putting up a couple of antenna on some towers in Manhattan outside of towers on a couple of buildings in Manhattan. And I said, I'm here from mobility. And she said, mobility, I know you guys, you still owe us $4,000 from the fees from your last antenna. And I was like, give me one moment, please. And I had to go check the mobility the company had been incorporated. Mobility B, we were mobility C, totally new company, right mobility B, had been folded up and sold to someone else, sold to one of our competitors, actually, Crown castle, and we had failed to pay that and then pass that on to crown castle. Crown Castle just ignored it when it was their project. But Yolanda was mad at me because it said on all the paperwork, mobility. Yeah, I'm my business card says mobility, and I can't convince her not credibly, that's not us. That's not us, ma'am. We are not that mobility. You gotta talk these other guys. So part of that is honestly listening to her saying, like, Wait, was what's, what do we need? What stress is this causing you in your job? Right? Because for her, it's not just me convincing her. I'm gonna one of my time is lobby. I'm gonna reveal a little bit, a little I don't it's a nugget or an operating principle that I had. Goal when you speak to someone is not to convince them that what you want is a good idea, that's not your goal. Your goal is to convince them that the people they report to will think it's a good idea, and that they will not incur any negative outcomes if they go along with your idea, and that maybe they might be able to receive positive outcomes if it goes to not, is this a good idea for the community or for you know, the company and people care that that a little bit, but their number one goal is to make sure that their job, their family is safe, like their income is safe. And so your job is not to convince them that this is a good idea. Your job is to convince them that their boss, the voters, their clients, whoever it is that they're answerable to, will be, will think that's will be, appreciate the choice they made. And so in this case with Yolanda, my job is not to convince her not to say this. My job is to see like what the pushback is on her spreadsheet every week, and her boss is constantly saying, like, why is there a $4,000 like, find out what happened to these guys, right? And I, I kind of sussed out that that's what it was. And I said, you lot, let me see what I can do to my boss. And so, like, I think we need to cut them a check for $4,000 he was like, no, no, we sold that company, that's the company that owes them. I was like, Yeah, but I got 98 antennas in Manhattan that we got to get up, and that's hundreds of 1000s of dollars in in fees in that game, work that we need done, and it's probably in the millions in terms of what our client is going to pay us. And if Yolanda doesn't get that red highlighter, the highlighted cell, out of her spreadsheet every week when she talks to her boss, we ain't getting those permits. Yeah, it was like, all right. And we cut the check, right, yeah. And we got our permits, and our antennas went up. I me that's part of it is it's not just convincing someone about the rightness of your position or or that it's listening and trying to evaluate what their needs and pressures are.\

Beautiful story. Thank you. Yeah, I'm going to jump now to simplicity. And it's interesting, because this is while I'm\
\
Mark Nabong  1:07:25  \
the wrong dude,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:07:26  \
innovation. And then we go, we go simplicity. And it's not just like making it, that you're not just dumbing down something or saying it in just two words, but it's the idea here is the ability to reduce complexity, because often complexity is it gets in the way. And I think your story, just so you know where I'm coming from, I think your story of saying, Let's pay the $4,000 is an example of simplicity as much as it is example of partnering. Because it's like, okay, what is, what's the highest priority? How do we like, just cut through this all and get to where we need to get others probably wouldn't see it that way, like it sounds like you're Boston at the beginning. So, I mean, you say you're not my guy. I'd love to hear why you think that. But then just tell me about kind of any experience where you felt like there were, there's a lot of stuff going on, and you were able to kind of create some, some clear priorities in all of that and make life easier for everybody to get their work done.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:08:28  \
Uh, yeah, that's a good question. I think I'm trying to think through because simplicity is funny. Simplicity is a tool, right? You're not going to simplicity for simplicity's sake. What you're really looking for is really looking for is effectiveness, right? And any extraneous processes, any extraneous you know, folks on the email chain like all of that, get in the way of efficiency, sometimes dramatically so, in the way efficiency and and I think probably you know, the being one or two is that, when I was in it's gonna wild opening to a sentence. When I was in Siberia collecting wooly mammoth tusks, it's a wild It's a wild sentence. The one of the things where we were in a small town in Russia called hatanga, it's North York circle, and the time you're peninsula, and it's maybe few 100, few 100 people, right? Maybe a few, maybe a couple of grand, because it used to be a military base, and there's a train depot there, but there's not that many folks there, and it's in the middle of kind of nowhere. It's in the middle of the tundra and the tiger, and we the reason I'm bringing this up is that there was some animosity from local folks. Most of them weren't Russian. Most of them were local ethnic group called the Dogon. There's some animosity from local folks who are us being there because it was mostly Americans, Dutch, Germans, Western, Western scientists coming in there and trying to collect mammoths. And so some wild stories came out. You know, they're exporting the tusks the to be sold as jewelry, right? They are. One of my favorites was they, when they take because you find frozen mammoth in the permafrost sometimes, like mammoth, like with flesh on it, right? One? Yeah, we had, we had a couple of them, right? In fact, when, if you're ever bored, you look up a Discovery Channel story about wooly mammoths. I think finding the mammoth or raising the mammoth with a professor named Dan Fisher, that was my advisor. There's much about there. But anyway, though there's, there's, there's a couple, like, almost whole mammoths that we've pulled out of the permafrost, and the rumor circulated that these Westerners were actually selling the mammoth meat to millionaire Westerners as a delicacy so they could try them. Like, you know, it's one of those things where you can't, you can go around and try to, try to fight this right, or you can ignore it and just let like, the resentment build up. But another option, and a more simple option, a much more effective option, is to just walk around the town and talk to people, right? Buy your bread the same place everyone else buys their bread, right? Don't have it shipped to the lab. Go send a dude, usually me, because that was the scrub, send a dude out like, talk to people, and you'll find that. And again, this place, it's, it's kind of a human connection element, again, but it's one case where you could, you could undertake whatever the post Soviet equivalent of a PR campaign would be, or you can just remind people that you do this and explain what you're doing. And just explain, in a small town like that, you explain to three people you've explained to 30, because they're all going to talk to people, right? And then you wait three days they've now explained to 90 and especially if you are unusual, which we were, which I am, especially in that area, and if you're memorable, and if you're kind, those Things go uncannily long way in in in building relationships and making your life much less complicated. I guess one thing that's emerging probably from this is a central philosophy of mind, which is that in addition to logistic processes that need to be made efficient, it's the humans that that execute those processes that need to be made efficient, and that's that efficiency is dramatically assisted if you can build an element of trust amongst the principles involved.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:12:52  \
Fantastic. So there's, like, this human element, and I'm curious, I want to go back. Like, why would you have said I'm not your guy? Like, why? What was, what was going on in your head? Like,\
\
is there something about simplicity that you feel uncomfortable with, that you prefer not to like? Or is this like, yeah, that's not my thing. No,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:13:21  \
when we talk about process simplicity, yes, when we're talking about verbal simplicity, I've never used three words when eight would suffice. So you could probably tell right, like we're talking about this. And I I can easily run over time. Okay, so, and I think that comes across, I suspect it comes across when we're talking like it doesn't take, it doesn't take a whole lot to prime the engine for this car, right? Like it just starts going\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:13:53  \
Cool. Well, I mean, I'm having fun here, so I appreciate that. Tell me about, I just want to dig in a little bit on process. If you were to, if you're in a situation where you're like, Oh, I could choose a job where I'm doing people interaction, like walking around, buying bread and talking with the presence of Syria versus the your advisors like, or you could work on trying to make this process for documenting everything we're doing more efficient. And like cross the t's and dot the i's, is there one you would prefer which? You know, which direction would you kind of prefer to go?\
\
Mark Nabong  1:14:36  \
Gonna sound like a cop on answer, but I promise it's not. I think I would be fine with either one, okay? Because in both cases, you're trying to solve a problem, yeah, and in both case, like in the, in the case of, you know, the the efficiency, where it's all the process that requires a lot more human interaction than probably we think, right? Particularly, you know, you sit down, you sit down with folks for two hours and try to figure out what makes them tick, right? The equivalent happens the people who designed or have to live with those processes. It is very ineffective to just parachute in and say,\
\
All of you get out of the way. I'm going to clean it up. Please cut the check to to Anderson Consulting, right? That's not going to work, right? It's it. If it effective. Process Improvement is requires the buy in and input of the people you're dealing with who will implement it or have to suffer the consequences. And in the same way, when you walk around and you interact with people. That's not it's as way the job should be. It's not merely I'm going to go talk to people. There is an element of analysis that's required. Who is the big man or woman in town? What will get me on their good side? Or how can I convince them that we're good folks, like we're not bad folks, right? Who are the people in town that other people avoid because there is guilt by association? If I become close buddy buddy with a local drug dealer, I'm not going to be well appreciated in town. If I'm unaware of the local reindeer festival, if I'm unaware of local norms, right, then I'm going to, I'm just, I'm just walking around for my own self awareness. Right? To be effective at the job, if you're doing a job like that, a public facing job, you have to have a level of analysis strategy, and you have to be able to communicate with your team, be work on why you're doing what you're doing. Listen, I'm gonna go out there. It's gonna look like I'm just talking about fishing with Sasha and and pIot. But I'm not pure. Father is the mayor of town, right? And Sasha is the local priest. There's only one Russia with an active priest in town, and he's a good guy. And him giving us the imprimatur pun intended goes a long way towards establishing a credibility here. So I think there's a level of analysis in the human interaction that's required in execution. There's a level of human analysis of human interaction that is required to effectively do the analysis.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:17:19  \
Love, it brilliant. Okay, we're going to move on to the next element, which is about this idea of talent enablement. And I'm going to take it all in one fell swoop, because I think again, these crossover a lot. But if you can share, you can share some experiences or stories of how you have coached others, how you've built and empowered teams and ultimately helped teams to accelerate their ability to achieve performance. I think there's a lot that you've already touched on, so feel free to reach back those things you've already talked about and refer to them, because I've already heard a lot that you've said that addresses that, but kind of anything you want to share there.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:18:02  \
Yeah, yeah. There's one story that I think I like. I know I like it. I was in charge of a small team when I was in telecom, I think three or four people, and my boss had none to get his own or\
\
they were fine and stuff, and he had a tremendous conflict with one of his with one of his reporting lines on his employees, where they couldn't stand each other. And she was, as he told it, and as I observed, not working hard, coming in late, like not being a very effective team member at all. And and he was like, I'm on I'm thinking about just letting her go, because you can't she's actually a negative drain on us. And I said, Alright, how about this? Give me a month or two. I can roll this one or two months. Have a report to me. I need the help, and you're going to get rid of her anyway. And let's see if we can turn this around and think you did a great job. Great job. But sometimes it just needs a different a different personality type. And he was like, All right, you want to do it, you know, take it. She transferred to me, and I sat her down the very first before we talked like, I said, like, Listen, I don't know what's going on, you know, with you. And mark the other, Mark, I don't know what's going on with you and mark, but, but as far as I'm concerned, like I've interacted with you at lunch, you're very intelligent. You clearly know what you're doing when you are negotiating these contracts on the phone. And I am going to make a guess that what you really need is you really need a manager to lay off you. You need someone that just lets you do what you know how to do. And and she said, you know, thank you. I appreciate that. I'm going to tell you I did not know that, but as taking a calculated guess that we have intelligent people, and they clash sometimes, one of the things that you need, particularly when they've been having a conflict with their manager. Over minute processes is the best. The best medicine for a, you know, a sore is to let it air out. Sometimes, the best medicine for a over, micro, over managed relationship is to under manage it for a little bit. And I said, you know I'm I'm going to trust you. I have, I don't. I don't care at all how you do your job. I don't care if you leave or come back. You go out and have a smoke. We need to. I don't care all I care about and I know you can deliver it, which is what I'm telling you, you have free reign. Is I just want the numbers at the end of the week. I want to know that the applications you put in weren't out there. I want to know that if there's any hearings or the like that we need to attend, that we've got them handled beyond that, I'm not I don't care what your job I'm not gonna tell you how to do your job. I'm just gonna tell you what the results I want are. You can always come to me if you need help, like I'll sit with you all day long, right, to help you with stuff, but I'm not going to pretend like I can do a better job than you. You have to come tell me I need help. And she said, I thank you. I appreciate that. The it took a little bit, a couple few weeks to settle into it, but to be quite honest with you, she was very effective at what she did, when she did it. And was she the best? We had no Well, she the worst, absolutely not. And the and a big part of it was not only setting the stage for her, but here's the second part. I think this is probably just as important, because I sat the team down now we had four people. I said, Look, we just inherited a pile. We inherited a pile of permits that didn't go through because the previous guy was laid off. This relates to a previous story about a guy kind of fudging his numbers a little bit, and so, like, we have to, you know, we've been tasked to fix this, right? So we've got a lot of applications we got to make if we're going to meet the construction deadlines for these polls. And here's what, we're a team here, right? Like, no one in this team gets any grief from anyone outside this team. All negative actions if we don't hit the numbers, if someone comes back pissed off because we set the wrong construct, none of it falls on any of you three. It only falls on me. If we do well, all the credit will go to you. And the reason I want you to do this is I want you to do what you do best, which is use your intelligence and use your initiative and get the crap done that needs to get done. And don't worry that you're gonna be thrown under the bus. Don't worry about making a mistake. Make as many mistakes as you want to get it, get the stuff out there. And you know, be you do your best. We had, I think, two or three months in a row, not that I think quantitative measures are the best for this kind of thing, but we had by far the largest number of permit applications sent from any of the teams for like, two or three or four months, something like that. And to the point where Mark, my manager, was like, I don't know what you did to get her, the lady in questions. I don't know what you did to get her working, but, but, but she's working. This is my way of telling. The reason I'm telling this story is when we're talking about, you know, unlocking talent. Sometimes what we think of as effective work is actually just us evaluating it looks like, what our affectability looks like. If you ask me, What does a handsome man look like? The odds of me just holding up a picture of myself might be very high like. This is what a handsome guy looks like. If you can't be aware that there are other types of handsome out there. If you can't be aware that there's other types of effectiveness, it is very hard to to succeed, because the odds of someone working exactly like you do, if your manager are low so, and also, if you don't have hiring or firing power, which I did not, right? If you don't have iron firing power, you gotta, you have to cook with the ingredients that they put in your fridge, right? Like you don't have a choice. Yeah, you'd want, you want a better cut of steak, but listen, you got Beanie Weenies in there. So you're going to have to, you're going to have to make dinner for those greeny weenies. And I is trying to listen and figure out what is not only effective for people, but also what gives them the chance to grow into what effectiveness could mean for them.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:24:44  \
I think those all combine really well. Like all of that whole story combines really well to help me think about kind of better understand your approach as a coach, as somebody who's empowering and building teams and elevating and I really did appreciate, actually, that you shared the quantitative stuff, at least, just kind of like, oh, we we got more permits and that sort of thing. Because I think that that's helpful. Because, I mean, everybody always is cared, cares about results. Did you ever use that approach, whether in that team or with other teams that you've led? Have you ever had somebody kind of take advantage of of the freedom or of the trust that you are giving them and kind of, I guess, end up really not delivering, and you're gonna take some heat that you wouldn't have been otherwise.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:25:31  \
Yeah, in this particular week, I'll tell two quick stories. The first one is this one where she was actually not consistent, right? There would be whole weeks where she would be the employee in question, where she wouldn't be very effective, but she did go through bursts of productivity and effectiveness, and it was contributed to by a lot of factors, but, but I did take heat, because there were times where she was clearly not doing her job right, like she's clearly like, just sitting around on her phone all day. And in those cases, you know, for the numbers, she never popped up as a problem in the numbers, in part because the way I tried to structure it was no one takes any heat on negative numbers. You sent me right. If the numbers are if the numbers are low, if we're not in our targets, you don't see a breakdown. You will not see a breakdown for me about who did what, but if are good, you'll see a breakdown, because then at least one, if not more, of my team members look good. And so in a way, some of her inefficiencies were masked by that policy. But it's also hard to hide. When it was an open office plans like, there's you had no walls, it was just like desks out, right? It's hard to hide that she was just kind of screwing around sometimes, and and in those cases, you know, you have a choice to make as a leader, because when you're a leader, you're still not the leader, right? Very few people are the leader. Everybody's accountable to somebody, right? And part of it is effective leadership down requires effective leadership up, which means that, like, look, I'm going to go to this, you're my boss. I'll say, Look, you know, Justin, people complain, and I know you complain to me about, you know, what Shawna is is doing, and what I'm going to do is, I'm going to ask her. What I'm planning to do is, I'm planning to ask her the tool on your phone, that's okay, but you go outside, because I can't have you setting a negative example for everyone else. But I will tell you,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:27:37  \
Okay, yep, I'm going to buy in another place now Justin,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:27:39  \
I will, I will continue my previous my my previous spiel, man, I do love anchovies. I've been cooking with anchovies a lot lately. Uh, they're perfect there. There's you don't need a lot of answer. You can use it one or two anchovies. You get tons of flavor. You know that salt, savory kind of umami taste. And so I've been, I mean, spaghetti, which is basically just a few anchovies, just a couple of anchovies in it, and Parmesan cheese and some parsley, and it tastes fantastic, like it doesn't need much I've made. I mean, omelets that are just little bit of cheese and spinach and anchovies. You don't need many anchovies, like it's great. The one problem I'm running into is that my wife cannot so I have to both side the I not hide, but I have to only prepare this when I'm not preparing food for us together, or we're not wearing food together, or I have to do it and then do it with all the windows open and the vent open and the door open, because, let me tell you, just like a little bit of anchovie goes a long way in terms of taste, a little bit of anchovy goes a long way in terms of ambient air quality,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:29:01  \
I'm back, and that was awesome. I really hope that the AI,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:29:04  \
did you hear that whole thing? I can't tell. Could you hear me when you're walking?\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:29:07  \
No, I put you on mute, not like when I got back room and I could hear the last part about anchovies. It was beautiful. Okay, good, okay, well, that was amazing. And it's funny, yeah, yeah. I feel silly because I sorry. I have to keep moving. That\
\
Mark Nabong  1:29:24  \
does bother me. It doesn't bother me. And in part, there's actually a story that I want to tell you, not just as part of this practice interview, but like in terms of overall philosophy, there is never been a project that goes off without a hitch. So if the plan is the project goes off without a hitch, it's already a failed plan, right? So it requires not only building in some you don't, you don't want a sandbag, but it requires building in a little bit of time, a little bit of money, a little bit of whatever, of a cushion, so that when the inevitable problems happen, it doesn't throw you off your game. And more importantly, it requires a decision to be made and a decision to be made before you start the project, which is, I am okay if things go awry, I am okay like the the the amount of grace you have as a person, not just as an employee or a professional or a leader, but the amount of grace you have as a person, is almost entirely determined by what You do when things have gone off the rail. Your grace is not when things are going well. Your grace is displayed in what you do when stuff goes pear shaped. So and it's an impaired Justin walk down the walk down the hall. He thought it wasn't even an issue. Well,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:30:39  \
thank you for your grace, yeah, and thank you for yours, because\
\
Mark Nabong  1:30:44  \
you're being very flexible as well. So thank you for that you're\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:30:48  \
good well. And you, you were just saying that you that with this, with this lady, you would say, hey, I need you to if you're going to look at your phone, you go outside so that we're not setting a bad example. I think that's where it was kind of, yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:31:00  \
well, that's what I told my boss, and that's, that's correct. Like, you know? He was like, that's gonna tell you, but I'm like, but the numbers are good. You cannot be talking about, you cannot complain about the numbers, right? He's like, right? It's like, okay, so whatever preconceived notion you have that she is not a good number of my team, I would like you to abandon them, because she's a good member of my team, a great number of my team. In fact, one of the things she does better than almost anyone else is when crunch time comes, like at the end of the month or whatever reporting period is. There's almost no one I have here that can get more done at an acceptable level of quality, as she may have problems before crunch time, right? But at crunch time, she's great, and we need here, because there are times when stuff goes pear shaped. We end up having to do more response more or, you know, someone's irritated about something. So I said, you need to make sure that you know, that you lay off her and my boss, like, probably you have to talk to her, because we can't have, you know, her doing this around. I pulled her aside, and I said, Listen, I'm getting heat, but I want the heat. I do not mind taking heat, you know, for you, because you're a great employee. And I repeat to her what I said to the guy, like, there's nobody here who gets as much done when push comes to shove as you, and so I absolutely do not want to lose you as an employee. And I told them like, you are very important to me, but what I need you from what I want from you is, if you are having a day where you don't feel like working, or your head's not in, your head space is not in, then you have two choices. You either go home and call and say, which is, I'm never going to give you a grief for that, like you may not have a PTO, but you're never going to get heat from me if you want to call in or or you set up a call with me, like a conference call with me, or a training call with me, a coaching call with me, whatever it is, and we go sit in one of the conference rooms for like four hours, and we just work. And maybe you're not effective, but now you're not being effective in front of other people, and and, and we can get work done there too. We can. We can also do it like as a team, I can go grab the other two folks and the team, we go sit in the conference room together, because we all know how valuable you are. So if you're having a rough day, like, we'll cover for you. And Justin, I'll tell you this. People, not everybody, but people tend to rise to what they think your expectations of them are, and they tend to drop to what they think your expectations of them are. And when I tell her she's amazing, she will behave at her most amazing rate and take credit for it. I'll say that she had the capacity to be amazing. And if you tell her, like, that's you know, that's what I expect out of you, more often than not, she'll rise to the occasion. And if you, if you come in frustrated and be like you're doing this again, we talked about this. I don't want to have to have this conversation again, or there'll be problems. You're you are not. You're only setting them up to hide their ineffectiveness. You're not setting them up to become more effective. Maybe some people do. Maybe some people respond to that. But I, I don't know many, and I am not good at it, right? So, so, yeah, I think those are the case. The other story I'm going to tell you is one in which we had a, it is a very slightly different story. I had a reporting line to me was being inappropriate with some of the ladies at a work function, like, after there's a little bit of drinking, like nothing, no touching, but still like, not appropriate. And say, Look, man, you're great, but you know, you know that we can't have this. And you know, you you talk to HR, I will vouch for you as an employee, like as effective you are, but I'm not going to cover that because I'm not going to make other people feel unsafe. I didn't say it that. I didn't didn't quite say it that way. But the gist was, you know, I am not going to go to bat for you in this. I'm not going to throw you under the bus, but I'm not going to go to bat for you. To bed for you in this and and, you know, because your job is, oh my gosh, I reached accordingly. Is that possible? Hold on one second. I'm going to quickly, if you don't mind, Justin while uh speaking, setting myself up for my own flexibility talk. Uh, if you go, give me one moment, I'm going to quickly purchase more minutes. Yeah.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:35:32  \
Oh, well, you can do that or, or we can just go ones we have because I'm recording it and zoom recording it so we have two others. That's\
\
Mark Nabong  1:35:41  \
true. But I do, you know, I I need, I need more minutes anyway. You know, we're still sweat six days before the end of the month, which is actually a, a horrifying example of, of a I'm gonna, if you, if you give me 30 seconds, here go for I'm gonna turn off my video, because I'm going to Go to otter and try to up the plan. I'm\
\
okay, give me one more minute. I'm going to talk so that you know that I'm still here.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:36:53  \
Take as long as you need. I'm good. All\
\
Mark Nabong  1:36:55  \
right, thanks, man.\
\
This really does show how much I probably how many meetings I've had this this month, which is great, like it's actually a good sign for us. But is this not i\
\
All right, if this doesn't work, that's okay. We will. We will use the other transcription available, but there's actually something to learn as well this before. We don't want this for myself, for these needs, make sure that we have more than adequate transcription space, right, available well, and\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:37:48  \
some of the ones I've been looking at are not real time. Can transcription so we, and that's what I wanted to kind of like look at. There's some that do real time, and others and zoom, but then others that you just upload the audio.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:38:03  \
Oh, that's kind of nice, yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:38:05  \
so you just upload the audio file and then it processes it for you.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:38:09  \
Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's see. Here I am. I\
\
All right, we are\
\
away i I'm still here, good. I'm just answering emails. So this is great. Now this is, this will eventually be great. Let me grab my business card. I don't know, one of the, one of the problems I've run into, it's not really a problem. One of the things I run into is that, you know, between working on, you know, what, the startups with people,\
\
with, you know, with LLCs that I myself was involved in, it could sometimes Be quite a dizzying management of the various cards accounts and like, I don't want to accidentally put the wrong charge on the wrong account. And now I've, and now I've, I've now inadvertently given myself the I pierced the corporate veil on myself.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:40:20  \
I know that's, I think it's one of the bigger challenges. It's like 10 different or not 10, but like, probably, what do I have six different Google accounts,\
\
Mark Nabong  1:40:29  \
right, right? No, seriously, me too. Or that me too. It's wild, and this is more info than you needed. But my, my business Amex card, which is my main one is someone tried to charge like 800 bucks on it at Home Depot. They caught it somewhere.\
\
So I had it resent to me. It's still in process being resented me, but I haven't gotten it yet. So I just tried to auto fill my my business card numbers. The this is like, Oh, wait, so we're we should be back. We should Okay, let me go back to this and turn off the turn on the camera, and so, start, start, start, start.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  1:41:28  \
All right, okay, and you were in the middle of saying that people step up to expectations when you just expect? Is that where you're at? Or did you go beyond that? That's\
\
Mark Nabong  1:41:39  \
right, if people step up when you you give them the idea to do, the belief that they that you know that they can step up, right? And again, it's not everybody, and it may not be to the level that you need them to step up to, because there is, there is a ceiling that is in some people about how much they can how much they can work. You know, how good they are as a friend or as or match partner as an employee, you know, whatever it might be. But you give them and yourself the best chance to get the most out of them. If you monitor, you pay attention, right, you don't just walk away, because that also is not effective, but if you give them the chance.\
\
Mark Nabong  0:01  \
So, yeah, so the people will rise to what you expect them to go to and lower. And there's plenty of other things involved. They have to have the resources, right? They have to have, you know, adequate pay, adequate Computer Support, adequate whatever it is the tools they need, you know, to do their job. But it's not, it's not just a matter of a correction or of or of faith,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  0:29  \
yeah, well, and I think that's probably, I mean, we're, I think we're at a good point to then jump into the next category, which is all about this agile execution. So again, these all enter interweave with each other. This, this one's about being able to deliver and kind of help achieve goals like you were just talking about, but also managing. So sometimes we're in the middle of a space and it's just like suddenly something happens, and we didn't expect it, and we have to deal with the change. I'd love to hear examples of pretty significant change that you've had to help teams manage through how you would manage as a team leader, to help people begin to do or work or interact in a different way than they have in the past, and or large system changes as well, could be something you could touch on.\
\
Mark Nabong  1:26  \
Yeah, I've got one, I think one, I'll tell you, is when I was working in telecom. It's funny how a lot of time in telecom was not, there's a number of years, but it wasn't the large one, but that's probably the one where I had the most people reporting to me, so that's probably why it's showing up here in the anecdotes, more than not. But one is that we had a database where we kept our notes and and our files for for this, and the company decided the previous database we had was inadequate, which it was was it was inadequate, and so they decided to launch a new database. And that went poorly, like incredibly poorly, because the it was soft launched, but we returned into it way too quickly so that we could stop paying the license on the old database. And so my team members and myself had to deal with missing notes. We had to deal with the date ticker system not working. We had to deal with a permission system that allowed people in the new system. It allowed anyone with editor access to alter any of the other notes, not that people were going in and intentionally doing it, but there was one where I was dealing with Secaucus New Jersey, and I had probably seven or eight pages of notes about how to deal with these guys, because they were very difficult to deal with, and a contract attorney who you had hired like to fill in, you know, for some capacity issues, went in and wrote his notes, but he didn't append them. He just erased mine. And and my team members dealt with the same thing. And in that case, I think when you're dealing with negative change, there is, there are a number of very natural human tendencies. One is to get angry. Another is to find the people to blame. And those are both Okay. Those are normal human tendencies, like you. 100% should do that. In addition to those, you you also need to not lose the thread. You can't, you know, let the setback part of resilience is not allowing the setbacks to prevent you from from staying on target. You might be slower to get to your target, but it cannot be that you are now going in a different direction, right? It is very easy to be deflected from your target goal because, gosh, Mike bought the worst software update in the history of the world, and you shouldn't have done it. And that's all true. That's all true, but someone resources have to be still applied to making sure that you're getting the documentation out, you're spotting to the subpoenas, you're responding to other attorneys who are trying to negotiate with you. And I think that's a case where, and I'll say myself, but also as part of the team of folks who are managing other folks. You know, there's a collective desire like, look, we can complain about, you know, all these problems in the database all day, and we should, you know, we should bear in mind that those complaints are real, but it's still May 17, we have 14 days, and we have to get these applications out if we're going to get the the towers built or the antenna built by the end of the summer and and I think when you're in a leadership position, and not even like official leadership, but when you're in a leadership position, your behavior rubs off on everyone around you. If they're panicking and pissed and looking for someone to blame, it's partly because you have been panicking and pissed and looking for someone to blame. And I'd say leadership also to drive home another point, which comes very clear in these kind of stressful situations where there's been external disturbances and the company's been thrown off of its its normal course, a leadership position should reflect or magnify the existing esteem and leadership that that person holds within the company. If your leadership is based entirely on your title, you actually do not have any leadership. You actually do not have any authority. The lead, the official authority you have should reflect and magnify what others already know or will already know about working with you. And it's at those stressful situations that you see, if you're paying attention, who the person is that will be good to have in charge, because he or she will be staying calm. They might be angry, but they will be staying calm, and they will be focused, and they will make the people around them, even the people who screwed up, they will make them work to fix the problem at a high level of effectiveness.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  6:17  \
Yeah, and so in your work, then when? And I think that's a really good example of the kind of facing a systems challenge. It wasn't a good change. It wasn't, wasn't done appropriately, and knowing how to help people through that. Would you say that you have been like that? Would you consider yourself more of a pioneer, somebody who's out there saying, hey, let's, let's try to integrate new technology and do new things. Or would you say you're more? You're more somebody who would say, hey, let's really kind of refine what we've got and focus on really getting getting good at what we got. I know that's kind of a generic, general statement, but yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  6:59  \
it's a good question. If I'm being honest, I'm more of the latter, in large part, not because I mind the pioneering position, but as a source of entrepreneurial innovation, which is what I'll call it. There is, there's some people, you know, and they're just a font of ideas. They're constantly cranking out they're constantly cranking out ideas, right? One of my business partners is like this, like, go on a call with him, try to talk about Project A. By the end of the call, he will have birthed the seeds of projects B, C and D, right? As the nature of the call is. So I'm not like that. Like, I like to run a project to, you know, to its conclusion, hopefully a successful one, and and make it more effective along the way, in a lot of ways, in a lot of ways, the the skill sets we're talking about having that I I seem to have, I think, are conducive to both. But I think a lot of times the people where the pioneers have to be, no they don't have to be, but they tend to be the people who came up with the ideas themselves, right? And that as a my role could be for that person to champion their ideals and carry it. Sometimes I have to be the spokesman for that person. Sometimes the person that is the Pioneer is not the one that has to champion the pioneering innovation. And in that case, in that particular case, I could be in what you call the pioneering subset, but then part that's because I'm filling in a gap that the innovator doesn't necessarily have, which is the ability to talk to a board for three hours without having without passing out or needing a glass of water, which is not an easy it was just not a skill set that replicates itself very easily across a number of people. So does that answer your question? I don't know. Yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  8:55  \
it does. I'm curious like so part of, part of this idea, and again, we're kind of in this we're in this category of agile execution. Part of this is figuring out metrics and numbers and like this metric leads to this metric, and kind of calculating all that stuff is that kind of, where do you prefer to spend your time when it comes to thinking about numbers, scorecards, metrics, what? What are some of your what are some examples from your career around that stuff, and where you would rather, you know, is it like you're just saying, Hey, I'm probably not going to be the first one to come with all the ideas, but I am definitely championing those ideas. Where would you metrics? I'm going\
\
Mark Nabong  9:42  \
to give a cop out answer, but again, it's a sincere one. It depends on where the metrics are coming from. I think if there are, if they are what we I will call good quality metrics. That is, they are based off good quality surveys, good quality decision, data acquisition. I really enjoy working with this, because, like, you can really see what's happening and what needs doing. You know, depending on the tool you're using, it's using Excel. You know, that's one thing. I mean, at one point in my life, I was much more effective with SQL than I am now. But like, you can, you can, you can run numbers and figure out, like, a lot of gaps. And that's that's really enjoyable, but, but in too many cases, the data is not very good, particularly in human interactions like this, right? Like sometimes, especially when you have a when you have more than four people gathering the data, man, you better have like a system in place, because, in my previous life as a as a behavioral ecologist, the amount of spread between the way someone codes mouse or baboon behavior and the way another person codes mouth or bad human ear is very wide. And if you are not very careful, your analyzes will be showing, in large part, an artifact of who is recording on those days. And to me, when we talk about metrics, I think sometimes there is a tendency not to over rely on them, because that that makes it look like I don't like metrics, but to not to put the kind of weight on metrics that we should have. I want to know, for example, if I'm if I'm analyzing it, I want to know, like, how is this collected? Who collected it? Before we look at my team and evaluate my team, I want to know that I have faith in it, or that I don't in the collection methodology. Because if, if we don't have good collection methodology, then we're not going to be able to proceed. So we're, you know, the in this particular case, and I suspect this will come up as we talk a little bit meta here, but as we talk through Saudi telecom is, I suspect the one things that will come up is, having been in telecom, there's going to be numbers that people rely on, like a lot. There's going to be numbers. And one of the things I think will evaluate people is their ability not only to use the numbers, but the the art, which is, where is there a part of my head that tells me when something's something's off, something doesn't feel right. I'm not seeing, or maybe I'm not seeing a genuine trend. Something is off in the in the analysis. And I think that that is a very hard to drop. It requires a lot of quantitative skill for someone to have that, but it is a qualitative assessment that he or she will have to make, to figure, you know, to to push back and say, like, Wait, hold on one second. Let's talk about this some more. Yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  12:37  \
okay, super, super helpful and a good, thoughtful answer. I think we're gonna, we've only got a few more minutes, and we are gonna spend, if it's okay with you, we'll spend, like, a few extra in minutes or so to make I'm\
\
Mark Nabong  12:48  \
here as long as you want, man.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  12:50  \
So we have one more section of this model, which is this idea of being a resilient steward. And it has to do with kind of stepping forward, saying I'm open to new ideas, my ideas, and always necessarily the best idea, but also being able to inspire others and have the grit and perseverance to move forward when things are tough. And so I'm curious about if you have any additional stories, or if you want to point to some of the stories you've already shared, where you feel like you've been able to demonstrate kind of that ability to to be open say, hey, it's not all about me, but then this just grit down and be resilient when things get difficult.\
\
Mark Nabong  13:34  \
That is an interesting one, because part of being able to grit down and identify the things become difficult is is determined by whether you recognize that it's difficult. Because there's some people, stubborn people, for whom they will not like they're unable to see that this is a difficulty for them. It's head down, go forward like I, you know? I get the good one aunt who had it very tough when she came to the US, genuinely a family where she lived, and it was raising a couple of kids by yourself. And if you asked her if she had grit, I don't think she would ever say that. I think she would say I had to do what I had to do. And one of the challenges in answering this question is asking, am I identifying when I've used grit because applied liberally chutzpah or grit resilience sometimes masks that you had to use resilience at all right, like, and, yeah, and so you don't know, because you're like, Nah, I'm not gonna, I'm not taking no for an answer. Well, right? We're gonna, we're gonna get this thing built, right? We're gonna get this project done. And so I think one of the things that I'm looking for here as I, as I call my memory bank is, all right. I got one. There is in Siberia. The way that your the way that it worked was on one of the trips to collect tusks, we actually got into an old Soviet helicopter since 2002 so so many have been long gone, and it's old Soviet helicopter, and they chopped us out, like, really far north into the tundra. There's no trees, right? It's the only things on. There's no like, grassy plants. It's just this layer of, like, short, short, like, Brio warty, kind of things, you know, Brio fighting kind of plants, right? Like, it's, it's, it's like a moss, but, like, a thicker, like a It's not Moss, but, like, it's like that, right? There's swampy, they're like, swampy plants. And so you get out there and there's, there's not a whole lot. There's no shade, right? Because there's no trees, and you get dropped off and and at the time, they dropped us off, and I had a bag, right, or two bags so I could collect the tusks, and we had some food with us, and we had a number of bottles of vodka, so if we ran into any reindeer hunters along the way, we could trade, you know, for other things. And we asked the gent who dropped us off, one of the guys, he was like, okay, in three days, we come back. In three days, we come back. And I was like, Okay, how will you know where we are, right? He's like, there is nothing. Just follow the river. We'll find you. Will find you. Just follow the river. So and So, seeing the chopper go off, I remember thinking at the time, like, this is, this is wild, because if I was thinking about this somewhere, actually, like, we had no satellite phone, right? We had, we had, we had a couple of emergency signaling blankets, right, and signals. But like in the middle of the tundra, like on the other side of the world, like, if something goes wrong, we're toast, right? Like, and, but it didn't occur to me at the time that that was the case, right? Because you're you're focused on the job. You've got a job to do, and you do it. So that a little bit to what we were talking about before. But here's where the grit part comes in. Okay? There is, at the time we were there, it was, it's north of the Arctic Circle, so there was no darkness, yeah, like the sun just went close to the horizon and went back up. And so one of the things that you realize, at least I realized it at the time, this is more physical grip than, like, you know, organizational, was that when you don't have a good place to camp for the night, you don't have an option, you have to keep going because you cannot. You can't camp on the river bank, right? You can't camp where the ground is uneven or not uneven, but unstable. You just have to keep going and the way tundra works is the permafrost melts. The permafrost doesn't melt because it's it's low enough in the ground, which stays frozen all year. That's why it's permafrost. But the ice above it melts in the springtime. And so you get these pools of water, like it's a lot of standing, stagnant water, and there's a lot of mosquitoes, like a ton of mosquitoes, and so you can't bed down in the water, right? And you have to find a place that's relatively dry, elevated enough where it's dry you can put your tent down, and you have to get in the tent, because when the mosquitos come out, there's a lot of them, right? Like they smell you from miles away. And there is a moment when you are tired, when you were hiking, carrying a tusk or two or three, you really would like to stop walking, but you can't. You can't. There's an element there where, as a human being, you have to accept the conclusion, I cannot stop I have to keep going. There are people in this world, and I'm going to include myself in this. In other situations where you can't but you do right? The rational part of you would say you can't stop, but the lizard part says, I'm tired, I'm sitting there, right? We've all seen people do it. They engage in self destructive behavior, they give up right before they succeed, like a number of other things. Yeah, there is a decision you have to make, and you have to make it at some point, which is, I am not going to let my frustration, my point level frustration, impede me from where I'm trying to get to, which is home, right? And I'm making this sound a little bit more dramatic than it was, but it is. You know, at three in the morning, when you're still walking, looking for a place to set your tent up there, there are thoughts in your head where you can't quite believe that you're still walking. And in an organization that has to come from a number of different people, not necessarily the person in charge, but there has to be a requisite number of people that say, like, we have to fix this problem. We're not just going to say, Well, that's it. I'm going to put in my resume tomorrow, because this company is toast, right? There's has to be at least enough people to say, Guys, we're going to get through this. We're going to work it. And even if we fail, we're going to fail standing. We're going to go down swinging. And that is that is not some people are more naturally attuned to it than others, but in almost all cases, someone has to make a decision, and an active decision that I'm not going to stop. Yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  20:13  \
what a great story on resilience that would be like a TED talk, right by itself, is that,\
\
Mark Nabong  20:18  \
look, I already have, like the I would have, like the head mic, like I'm already I'm already halfway there.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  20:23  \
That was really good. Are you in here? Okay,\
\
Mark Nabong  20:30  \
this is also resilience. This is also an example of resilience.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  20:33  \
I'll make a move. Yeah. I\
\
Mark Nabong  20:40  \
I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm just going to talk because, you know, I want the AI to have something to think about me in there. I a number of years ago, I my wife and I reading a book on minimalism, about having less stuff. And it was pretty inspirational. And the one of the phrases that we jumped out to me was the phrase, have Less? Do More be more? We realize have all this stuff, like, we keep buying these apartments, or they say, Hello, I'm back.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  21:12  \
You're\
\
Mark Nabong  21:13  \
back. That\
\
Justin Newey Allen  21:14  \
is funny. I think these students, there's some reservation system, and they Yeah, they need to be in the one they reserved. And so, like, they're the ones here,\
\
Mark Nabong  21:24  \
yeah, well, we were the but we were the ones who did that at Island, right? Like, we reserved it. Like, I'm sure people walk by, like, yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  21:38  \
we're on to the next thing here. So I'm going to show that they'll chart again. And when I do that, I'd love to get your perspective on your own kind of the strengths that you have, and then areas where, for you personally, it you're maybe not as strong, or it's like, it's not as important. And the example I give is, you know, soccer, or football around the world, is a pretty popular sport, and one of the things I've seen is that some leaders go to the equivalent of the goalie and they say, Hey, what's your problem? You're not scoring goals like I've been tracking you for the last time. I\
\
Mark Nabong  22:21  \
like that. I like that.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  22:24  \
And by the way, what do we do here? How do we win? What we score goals, and you're not doing any of it. So that's a problem. I think. I mean, it's kind of a ridiculous analogy. But the point is, is there are some things that true, we need to be good at, and other things that maybe aren't as important for our effectiveness. So what I'd love to do is, as I share this example with you, if you can see my slide, let me know when it pulls up. For you, sure it's\
\
Mark Nabong  22:49  \
loading now it hasn't quite come up. There it is. I got\
\
Justin Newey Allen  22:51  \
it. As you look at these bullet points, if you were to pick two that you're like, you know what? For me, in my style of leadership, in the role that I have this is where I'm really strong and where I need to be strong. And then maybe pick two where you say, You know what? This is not as important to me, or it's maybe not a strength. So where would you pick the strengths in the two areas that not as big a deal? The two\
\
Mark Nabong  23:17  \
strengths, I think, are under resilience steward and talent enabler. I think that managing people, sorry,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  23:25  \
I'm interrupt. I'm going to push you to the bullet points. So I didn't, I wasn't. Oh, the bullet points. Okay, so bullet point. So I apologize, yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  23:36  \
let's say I'll pick inspire under resilient Stewart, okay, and on a talent enabler, I guess either elevate or coach one of the two. Maybe I'll say elevate. Let's say inspire and elevate for talent enabler, and I'll explain why in a minute, and then for places where I need to improve. Because I think actually, all this is important. And I think you don't, you don't you don't make a you don't make a sandwich by saying, you know, the bread is more important than the meat, like it's not really a sandwich unless you have a bread. So I'd say for the for two that I am not as strong about, but I want to be better. One is innovate in the sense that I would love to have met exercise the mental muscle that it takes to look for novel solutions. Um, novel novel problems and novel solutions. There's some folks where, like, their brains are naturally scanning, or they're making themselves scan for those. And I would like to strengthen that muscle, that mental muscle, yeah, one of the things that that I think I could be better at is because I actually, I actually enjoy the doing the stuff under agile executor. But one thing that I would like to be better at is deliver. Yeah, I adapt pretty easily, right? And I'm very I'm quite good at marching off, you know, into the wilderness whenever it's something that needs to be done. Like, I like doing new things, even if I'm not necessarily the one who's concocting the plan. But I think deliver is something I need to work on, in large part because it's this deliver. This is the vanishing point for all these other items. It's not the most important. That's not the case at all. But what mostly is seen is that point is deliver. When you when people ask what happened this year, sometimes they'll talk about this other stuff. When it gets reduced to a bullet point for the board or for the shareholders, it's going to be right there, deliver. And so that's a place where I would like to be better at identifying what needs to be delivered, and really focusing on making sure that that happens. In large part, it's not a zero sum game, but it can feel that way, because the more time I spend coaching, sometimes you can feel like I'm not delivering as much, which is not true, because if you're coaching effectively, you're actually delivering more the more time you spend trying to simplify the process, right? That simplification is not being reported at the end of the year, right? If it results in delivery increases it will be reported at the end of the year. But if you simplify the process, and this year, it doesn't deliver, but it will in three years, people are still going to it's going to require somebody to have you walk through it. So that's one in which deliver I would like to do better at, because for some reductive analyzes, that is all that people see.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  26:50  \
Okay, brilliant. So now tell me about your hopes and dreams for the future, and we could spend another two hours. I'm sure this is a topic, but just kind of succinctly, what would you say? What do you what do you hope for in your career, in the next three to five years? What do you hope to accomplish, and what do you hope to be doing?\
\
Mark Nabong  27:10  \
You know, I It's funny, because I actually, I actually do almost every day. I actually do a review of both a, you know, my personal mission statement, my personal constitution and my goals list and and so I'm, I think I'm pretty I don't know if this is a breaded answer that it never feels, you know, complete, but I think, like you talk about my career over the next few years, what I'd like to do is three things, and it's one of the reasons why I want to get into goal development and sustainability. So one is to, you know, provide for my family like, that's the easy one that you want. I would like to be earning at a reasonable clip, whatever that means, right? But like to, I'd like to earn as much as is ethically and lifestyle allowed, right? I don't want to, I don't want to not see my kids, right? I like the I really appreciate this, the time for this call, because my kids get to help get the kids ready for bed, and they went to bed, and I come here for it, right? So I like to reasonably make an income that allows me to be a father and to be a husband. The second is, I would like to do it in a way where it allows me the constant stimulus of either new people, new clients, new problems. I whether it's my ADHD or other aspects of my personality. I like being able to solve problems, you know, a new problem, for a new company or new people, and I need that kind of constant stimulus. There are some people that are very good at doing the same thing over and over and over again. I'm not one of those. I wish I was, in some ways, but I'm. I'm not for me to be effective at a I need to also be cycling through B and C and so that's, that's part of my effectiveness. I mean, the third part of my professional career goal is, I would like to make an impact. It doesn't have to be the biggest impact. I don't have delusions, but I'm going to save the world. But I would like it that when the scales are balanced at the end, I would like, you know, there to be some parts of the scale that says, you know, he did. He did. He left the world, hopefully a little bit better than he found it. The ancient Egyptians in their, in their their death. Mythology believed that at the end of the world, at the end of at the end of your life, Anubis weighs your heart on a scale against a feather, and if your heart is heavier than a feather, you go down. If your heart is lighter than a feather, you go up and and part of what I'd like is that at the end that I've been less of a weight, on my community, on the world, on the people around me, that I have been a reduction of weight.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  30:04  \
That's beautiful. Very cool. Well, I'm going to close with something, and just for the two of us, I don't know if I'm going to include this in the interviews. It's not something they asked for, but I want to include it just to have the conversation with you and decide if we should, and if we do, then I don't know if this is the best place for it, because I really do like ending right there, right? But I'll share a screen real quick. I might have shared this research with you in the past, but this research is done couple of Professor Harvard several years ago. Did I talk to you about this? Good Soldier? Expert accelerator, yes, yes, yeah. And I reference it a lot. One of the things I do in some some interviews, I do, is I try to get a sense of where people see themselves, but also where they see their direct reports. So I would be asked or team members, I should say, in this case, because some of them, well, they'll all have direct reports, but so maybe, maybe we stop this conversation, and then we can talk about this either now or later. And I don't want to. I know it's late, late for you, so I'm\
\
Mark Nabong  31:14  \
fine. I'm totally fine. I'm totally okay.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  31:16  \
I'd like to get a sense of whether we include it or not, because it could be some interesting insights for them that they're not expecting, and so hopefully delightful for them, but but also helpful as we coach to help people think about this language. So introducing it now could be helpful later, as we talk about, well, this sounds like a good soldier mindset, or sounds like an expert mindset, or versus like the accelerator mindset. So we'll stop now. I have, well, I actually have\
\
Mark Nabong  31:40  \
a couple of thoughts. If you don't mind, please share. Sharing the thoughts. So real quick, I think I remember this, and one of the things I thought before, and then I'm thinking about now, is, if I'm a reasonably intelligent person, I'm going to read this, especially if I'm one gunning for leadership position, and read this and say I got to answer in a way that makes me seem like an accelerator. Yeah, right. Like, that's what they're going to discretion their whole, their whole words about it. I think it's important to not so this at the beginning. Yeah, right. But to ask, in your opinion, you know, just give them a chart with Justin not, don't separate them out into groups, but if I give them a chart, and you know you have seven or eight circles you can make, or maybe four, you know, three or four circles you can make circle the three or four things out of this list of what 12 items that you think are most important to making, to making your team work every week, right? So it's not necessarily about them, but it's you try to tease out their value set, and then at the end, right, maybe even before that last question, right? Well, no, maybe you want them to ask that last question, but the end, one of the things you can say is that, you know I'm going to here's the list again, and after hearing you talk about yourself right now, we asked about your team before talk about yourself. Circle the three or four that you think are your strengths, like at the end and and the reason why I'm suggest we do this is you, I think you want to evaluate where people fall into this, into this, right? Because you don't want, because the everyone nominates themselves to be leading, right? Everyone wants to be chief. Everyone wants to be the quarterback, but not everyone's a quarterback, and so as the coach, you got to decide who's the quarterback or who's a lineman or who's a wide receiver, and I think getting their input, and especially after hearing them talk for two hours, getting their assessment of themselves, might give you another data point as you try to evaluate not only is this person good for leadership, but is this self is this person self aware enough of their own strengths to be a good candidate for leadership.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  34:03  \
Yeah, well, and yes, I think one, one goal is definitely to kind of assess where I think they're at. And that's what we'll be doing you. And I will be kind of saying, Okay, where do we think they're at? I think there are two other goals in in potentially during this. One is that in coaching, I really like to refer back to this.\
\
Mark Nabong  34:24  \
I see Yeah, and\
\
Justin Newey Allen  34:26  \
and so I like, sorry. I'm like, looking at people in a windows here, wondering if they they're just hoping to come in, or if they have a reserve. You have reserved. Okay, they have reserved. All right. I'll get out here in just two minutes. But like, I'm thinking it would be really helpful to, like, let them be aware of it. And then when we come back with you, like, remember, we have that conversation. This is where I'm seeing you, so part of it's their awareness. And then the third thing is to say, hey, what? Where do you see your group? Because people are readily going to say, oh, yeah, I'm totally an accelerator. But you know what, everybody who works for me is a good soldier, right, right? Like, the unique kind of gift to them would be to say, well, you know, we've talked to all of your VPS, and they, you know, collectively, say that 80% of the people that report to them are good soldiers. Hmm?\
\
Mark Nabong  35:26  \
I'll just keep talking so that the notes keep getting transcribed, and then we'll pick up again in a minute, talking, talking, my one of my favorite animals is the platypus. I like it because it's a monotreme, which is the name of my company. It's a monitor that's a particular grouping of mammals. They're the egg laying mammals. There's only a few mammals that lay eggs. One is the platypus. The other two are different species of spiny anteater. One of the reasons why I like the platypus is it is it is termed, we often describe it as a combination of other animals. It's got the bill of a duck, it's got the tail of a beaver. It's got poisonous spurs, like it has a venom like a snake and but when it comes down to it, the platypus is not like that. It's actually from an old branch of the mammalian family. So in a way, like its novelties are endemic to it, it is not a combination of other things. What it is is its own animal that, to other people, seems like a mishmash of other straits, but from the perspective of monitoring of the platypus and its family, it is the breather has a platypus tail, not the platypus doesn't have a beaver tail. Yeah, I'm back. The duck has a platypus bill, not the Oh, yeah, there you are. Can you hear me? Welcome back. Can you hear me, I'm here. I\
\
Justin Newey Allen  36:59  \
don't know what can can you hear me? Okay, I'm gonna I'm in like, an open space, because I think we're almost Okay, yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  37:05  \
yeah, I can hear you just fine.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  37:09  \
All right. Well, I think perhaps just going forward, we can think about whether it makes sense to to kind of include this, yes or not. I think we're more than enough to fill up the two hours. Just if we think it'd be helpful,\
\
Mark Nabong  37:22  \
you could even put it at the end and say, like, this is really effective, right? And I'm going to show you this chart, just so you have it and you can use it. And when we talk again, it will be you will talk through what composition of your team you think should look like, what the composition of your the leaders you hire should be like, yeah, and then, and maybe the composition of yourself, that's, that's.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  37:52  \
Well, good. Well, Mark, you are amazing, and I'm more impressed now after learning about your life for two hours, Oh,\
\
Mark Nabong  37:59  \
I feel I apologize. You got to hear about it for like, two hours. It feels, I mean, it's fun for me. Yeah, and you're, by the way, you're totally right. Like, when you say, like that, that, that didn't feel like two hours at all. It didn't feel like two hours\
\
Justin Newey Allen  38:16  \
at all. Well, here's what I'll do. I'm gonna, I'm going to take this recording, I'm going to put in one of those transcriber tools and get a transcription. If there's a way to send me the transcription from otter AI and from I will do that. Then I will send those three transcriptions and and we'll see if we can kind of get them to put into a report. And then be interesting to see how close we get to what I create. And then we'll go, we'll go from there.\
\
Mark Nabong  38:46  \
That sounds good. I will get those to you. It might take a little bit for the transcription, in summary, to process, but I'm going to have here send transcriptions to Justin, and I know Audra will tell me to do the same thing. And the other thing I'll mention is that I got a couple of leads on people who have Arabic accents that might be willing to sit down, whether it's for the whole two hours or for a portion of it. You know, we could talk it out, but I will see if any of them are available not to talk next week for\
\
Justin Newey Allen  39:25  \
you. Okay, that would be amazing, yeah. And like you say, if we're just testing the extent to which the transcribe transcription tool picks up, you know what they're saying, we probably don't need the full two hours. We could just talk to 20 minutes. But if we want to do a full test and then see what it looks like. We could do that too, if they're open to it. But I don't take somebody's time for two hours unless they're like, Oh, this is cool. I'm happy to answer.\
\
Mark Nabong  39:49  \
Well, I mean, I thought this was cool. Like, I don't know how representative I am, but this is, it turns out, hearing my own voice for two hours is pretty damn enjoyable to me, which probably says something negative about my personality, but\
\
Justin Newey Allen  40:01  \
not at all. I think it's pretty much everybody. It's, it's actually funny. I was, at one point, I was thinking, wouldn't it be I mean, that's, I guess, in some ways, what therapy is. But wouldn't it be funny just to like, offer as like, a solution, just come in, you just talk for two hours. And yeah,\
\
Mark Nabong  40:20  \
I gotta tell you, man, like, when I was a divorce lawyer, you know, I was lawyering a chunk of it, but a chunk of it was literally just being kind of a therapist, like, get it out. Like, you know, tell me what's going on your life. Like, you know, the edits and we had a social worker. Thank God, because I wouldn't, I was not equipped to handle most of these. But, like a lot of people, are not asked to self reflect or self evaluate enough, and so when you get a little bit of the taste of cake, you want a lot of cake. Yeah.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  40:52  \
Well, cool. Thank you for doing this. This is super helpful.\
\
Mark Nabong  40:55  \
No, thank you. Thank you for taking the time today and for doing it through, you know, very challenging circumstances. We're trying to roll around BYU campus.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  41:06  \
So it's all on me. I made the mistake like we were like, looking at times. I was like, Oh, I can make that work. I'm sure there'll be things like, I'm sure\
\
Mark Nabong  41:13  \
there'll be a place, yeah. Well, well, now you scoped around the campus again. So at some point, if I ever come out to visit you, maybe I can convince you to go to a BYU basketball game with me at some point. So, yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  41:25  \
absolutely fun. Well, this is\
\
Mark Nabong  41:27  \
really fun, man, I appreciated it. Mark\
\
Justin Newey Allen  41:29  \
and I get When's our next conversation Do we have? So\
\
Mark Nabong  41:32  \
we haven't scheduled one yet. I don't think, but I'm free Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, because I know, I know you've got to turn around pretty quickly to be ready for for the telecom conversations. So if you want to meet Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday, I'm happy to do so yeah,\
\
Justin Newey Allen  41:50  \
and I, I mean, I guess it depends on what I want to be supportive to you in the coaching because we hadn't yet talked about your you were, you weren't sure if you\
\
Mark Nabong  41:59  \
say, Hey, this\
\
Justin Newey Allen  42:00  \
is what I want to do, or not. So I'm happy. I want to have that conversation. But other than that, I don't know if there's anything else going forward that's urgent. Next week, on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I have my co active coaching classes. Oh,\
\
Mark Nabong  42:13  \
awesome. And\
\
Justin Newey Allen  42:14  \
then also I'm doing my first first course. Are you taking? Are you start taking courses this semester with Harvard. No, okay, I've got my first course on Tuesday as well. So that's\
\
Mark Nabong  42:27  \
really fun acts\
\
Justin Newey Allen  42:28  \
the first four days of next week, but I want to be there. You have, if you'd be helpful, to have a conversation.\
\
Mark Nabong  42:33  \
I think, I think we're good if I have some thoughts about which ones to take, but they're not concrete yet, because I'm still flipping back through the list I got through a number of them in light of our conversation before. But how about this? If you want to schedule a, you know, 15 minute touch base next Friday, that would work great. That's\
\
Justin Newey Allen  42:57  \
That's great. And my after 8am my time, actually, my calendar is surprisingly totally open. So if you want to just shoot a 15 or 30 minute block anytime that works for you, that's that'd be perfect.\
\
Mark Nabong  43:10  \
Okay, let's do tentatively 1pm Okay, Alright, great. Thanks, Justin. Thank you so much. Mark. Good\
\
Justin Newey Allen  43:20  \
luck. Good luck prepping\
\
Mark Nabong  43:20  \
for the call. This was incredibly enjoyed. Incredibly enjoyable. So thank you so much.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  43:24  \
Thank you. I sincerely love learning all about you. I am I like and the wisdom, I'm going to take a lot of that back, so thank you.\
\
Mark Nabong  43:32  \
Oh, well, I'm glad was there wisdom. We should write that down. I should write that so\
\
Justin Newey Allen  43:35  \
much wisdom. We're gonna have three transcripts of it. So that's\
\
Mark Nabong  43:38  \
true. We don't. It's hard to publish\
\
Justin Newey Allen  43:39  \
it. Okay, great man. We'll\
\
Mark Nabong  43:41  \
get we'll get home safe. I'll talk to you soon.\
\
Justin Newey Allen  43:43  \
Good night. Sleep well, bye.\
