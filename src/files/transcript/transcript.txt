So, hey, Mark, thanks so much for making time. I am sure you are a very busy person. And so taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with me here is really, really helpful. And I'm excited to get to know you better on this call. Before we get started, let me just ask, I know you received the email. Did you have any questions or did you feel like you understand what this is about? Or would it be helpful for me to give you a brief overview about what we're doing here?
01:16 Speaker: I would appreciate a brief overview. I understood it, but you can always miss something. Yeah, absolutely. I have had the opportunity to work with leaders like yourself for the last 20 years. I've actually done a lot of work in the Middle East and where you're at in Europe and other places around the world.
01:40 Speaker: And one of the things that we found to be extremely helpful is to give leaders an opportunity to have a conversation like this. With me, I do a lot of executive coaching and leadership development to really get a sense of... what you've found to be helpful so far in your career, and what are some things that you'd like to continue working on. So while as labeled, this is an assessment, I will be kind of, we're recording this, as was mentioned in the email, and we're going to be taking a look at that transcript and creating a report for the folks there in talent development. At the same time,
02:18 Speaker: this is more than an assessment this is an opportunity for you to kind of reflect back on what's worked well for you in your career and think about what you'd like to continue working on going forward and that's really how i hope um you you benefit from this because i think really i wouldn't want to do this if you didn't feel like you were getting a benefit so that's that's really what it's all about
02:39 Speaker: And it'll help me and then those who I'm providing the report to to better understand your leadership experiences, opportunities for growth. We'll explore how you've demonstrated some of the key competencies that we're looking for during the course of your career. And I'll be asking you to provide some examples. So I'll be asking you to say, hey, this is when I did this or this is when I did that. And so what I would ask as we get going here is that.
03:08 Speaker: If you can try to be as candid and open as possible and just share with me where you're coming from. And we have two full hours. It might seem like a lot. Most people I talk to actually say it goes by quickly. I hope that's the case for you. But yeah, I think as we go through it, I would just say kind of be as transparent and open as you can. And that will help both you and also help me to better understand what I'm going to do with this information.
03:37 Speaker: I mentioned a transcript. Nobody will see the transcript besides myself and my team outside of STC. What I'll do is I'm going to put together a 10-page report. And in that report, that will be shared with... our colleagues there and in leader and talent development and so um i don't think at this point that that will necessarily be shared with you though some organizations choose to share those eventually um so i hope that you can just feel comfortable saying everything and then i'll kind of digest it and think about it and put into that report did that help or do you have any other questions no that's great is that 10 pages about me good question yeah so um
04:23 Speaker: It's, yeah, 10 pages, but a lot of it actually is about the competencies, which I'm going to get into in a moment. So when speaking actually with Oleon, our CEO, and some of the other senior leaders, I had the opportunity to really get an understanding of what's happening next here in the organization. And so that's...
04:46 Speaker: That's kind of what we're going to be looking at is what are the skills needed to go forward. 
05:50 Speaker: Well, then let's go ahead and get started. And by the way, well, before we get started, I saw like in your CV that you got a law degree and it looks like it was from a school in the DC area. Is that, am I reading that right? That's right. That's right. I got my law degree at Georgetown in DC. Okay. Yeah. Tell me about that. What was that like for you? I mean, just, I know this is not like kind of what we're doing here. I'm just curious because that's pretty cool.
06:18 Speaker: It was great. I honestly love law school. I also met my wife there. So that's probably the most important output of my years there. But even leaving aside my own personal happiness, it was really good. I had gone to grad school in paleontology and evolutionary biology, which is great. And I loved it. I still love the subject matter. But it was not.
06:48 Speaker: It was not a good place for me in terms of my career because I'm kind of a city person, and I saw people much smarter than me go to wherever there was a university tenure-track job to go to. And so after some reconsideration and some soul-searching, decided to leave grad school, went back to Chicago for a bit, and then went to law school.
07:15 Speaker: So for me, law school was, I told you that background because law school was an attempt for me to be both intellectually engaged and also put myself on a career path and a life path that would be more in tune with the way I wanted to live. So law school was great for that. Every, every job, everyone wants like five or six things from their job, right? They want money.
07:42 Speaker: They want it to align with their values. They want to have autonomy and feel like they can make a difference. They want it to align with their lifestyle. And they want something that they can be proud of and their family can be proud of. And no one job does all of those things. And what was valuable for law school for me was it allowed me a greater range of possibilities than I would have had otherwise in terms of assembling a career afterwards. And so that's how I ended up there.
08:12 Speaker: That's fabulous. And actually, you just touched on a lot of the things I was hoping we could talk about. So maybe we'll just even dig in there. But before we do that, I just want to tell you, hey, way to go. Because I found, as I've worked with a ton of leaders around the world, it gets very easy sometimes for people. to get into a space like you were it sounds like you were with paleontology and then just stay there even though maybe they've they're not completely satisfied with where they're at so i just have to say i'm very impressed just from the get-go here that you were willing to make that jump and i i know that i mean taking the lsat getting the law school is not easy especially at a place like georgetown so super impressed um thanks for thanks for sharing that with me well thank you i don't know if it's impressed
08:59 Speaker: I don't know. I would be impressed with me, but I'm glad that I made the choices that I made. That's cool. Well, I mean, let's actually let's go back. So I want to hear. So you mentioned Chicago. Is that where you grew up? I grew up in Chicago. OK, cool. And so what was your. Tell me. I mean, you know, we don't need like a ton of detail here, but I'm just curious about.
09:20 Speaker: When you were growing up in Chicago, what was it like when you were kind of in your high school years? What, how did you spend your time? What did you do? Like, what was your favorite class? Just tell me a little bit about, I just kind of want to get to know you. Like who was the 16, 15, 17 year old Mark? Uh, I don't know that he knew. And I don't know that I know. I think when you, when you're in high school, I'll talk about me. I won't make this general. When you're in high school.
09:47 Speaker: your clay and one of the strange parts about being that age and that phase of life is you're constantly reshaping your own clay because you haven't fired it yet yeah right you haven't put it in the kiln um and so you you know high school mark was probably you know a uh a nerd um who who studied a lot and was in academic bowl um but high school mark was also a uh a varsity wrestler um
10:16 Speaker: and uh and you know i also had played i played dungeon dragons like i i hung out with friends which is i think hopefully everyone does and everyone can um but you you all of those facets like become you're kind of a different person in each one of those you're still you yeah um but um i think a mark of high school is for me was constantly trying on personalities because i'm trying on um
10:44 Speaker: Honestly, my approach towards what I would now call philosophy or morality, but at the time I was trying to figure out what I believed in and what the principles I had were. Teenage Mark was the right mix of certainty and uncertainty and unearned self-confidence.
11:13 Speaker: tremendous self-doubt that i think is probably somewhat common to a lot of teenagers so um i think that the one thing that i'll say that might be interesting is uh that i grew up in a very ethnically um and culturally diverse area in skokie illinois and uh that's where my high school was in skokie and one of the features of high school mark was at the time i didn't have a strong
11:42 Speaker: strong sense of difference between people. I mean, you knew who your Jewish friends were, you knew who your Muslim friends were. But at the time, I don't think I clocked to how deep those differences can feel for people later on in life. And so one thing I am really thankful for is that my parents had us in that community and raised us around other good kids. And so that...
12:11 Speaker: The thing that I've been able to carry, I hope, is I can always think back to that as you get older and the world wants you to lithify and it wants you to solidify yourself. And it's nice to go back to that more uncertain time where the differences between people was much smaller than the differences between myself from Monday and Tuesday.
12:40 Speaker: That's fascinating. And thank you for sharing that. Thanks for being so open. Because I agree. I think all of us in our formative years, and even still today, we're still trying to figure out who we are and what we understand and know and how we're going to interact with the world around us. I love that you had some of those formative experiences.
13:03 Speaker: You know, we all face challenges and struggles at different points in our life. Did you feel like, were there any kind of major challenges that you feel like this was a hard thing and then kind of how you worked through it? Whether it was, it doesn't have to be monumental, but something that, is there something that happened during those formative years before you turned 20 or so that you were just like, wow, here's, this is a big thing for me? Yeah, actually. And I only have the language to describe it recently. But at the time,
13:33 Speaker: I had a problem with being able to just sit and work, right? How to concentrate, how to get my work done. I was a, I don't know if you'd say that I was an intelligent kid, but I tested really well. I tested incredibly well. But my grades did not reflect it, or at least they didn't line up with it, in part because of my own inability to.
13:57 Speaker: what I said at the time, manage time, my own inability to get things done on time or at high quality was rough. And now I have the language to look back and say, I have a CHD. That's why I couldn't sit and concentrate. That's why the normal study tricks that I tried to pick up from my parents or family members and friends didn't work. But I think the struggle was that the normal way of sitting.
14:25 Speaker: and studying when we're working wasn't working for me uh and i i think there were a couple of times where i could have just put my hands up and said like i'm a bad student yeah right like what are you gonna do i'm a bad student throw me throw me in the ash can of people that showed a lot of farmers but did nothing with it and um one thing i am proud about i'm saying proud not for me but for being the support network sure is that we found a way to build
14:52 Speaker: I found a way to build techniques that work for me. So to give you one example, to give some color to this, I don't know the way. We'll typically study. They go to the library or they sit down at their desk and they sit down. It doesn't work for me. I need a lot of distraction. My brain is like a three-year-old that needs to be constantly distracted by things so that the active part of my brain can concentrate. So sitting in a quiet room was the death knell for my productivity. I did learn that if I had a TV on,
15:22 Speaker: or music on or both or multiple tvs it helped distract the non working part of my brain so that i could study so that i could write and it's one of those things that when you the reason i mention this is there are techniques you will adopt for survival for effectiveness for efficiency
15:46 Speaker: They're not written anywhere. They're not written in any book. They're not written in any guide. At least they weren't at the time. At the time, you just have to trust your pole star and say, okay, I need this to work. I empirically know that when I do this, I work hard. And when I don't, I don't work hard and just lean into it and accept it. And that took a while. It took a while in part because there is a strong difference, a large difference between what looks like effective work and what is effective work.
16:15 Speaker: at least with this particular set of conditions that i have yeah so i could either choose to look like i'm working okay which is when i sit with a book yeah with that in my mouth think about it but i'm actually doing nothing i'm actually thinking about nothing yeah or put on headphones put a tv on in the background um and stare at a blank piece of paper or stare at the book for a few minutes which does not look like work to anyone else but
16:44 Speaker: I know that I'm processing what I'm reading. Or I am mentally reviewing what I just read and coming up with my own thoughts on it. And I think that is the main story I guess I'll tell you out of your question, which is that at a younger age, I came up with, and again, this is not the language I would have used back then, but it's the language I have now. I came up with a way to make a faulty bit of machinery.
17:13 Speaker: uh that is my brain work right like sometimes um you know sometimes you can uh you can get down the street in a working car yeah and sometimes you have to duct tape a whole bunch of bicycles together yeah um and and in this case like you know i have to duct tape a whole bunch of bicycles together and just accept that it's not going to look like effective transportation to anyone else wow that
17:40 Speaker: So thank you for sharing that because that will help me think about things going forward. And it actually ties to where we're going next. As I mentioned, this report that I'm going to put together, it's based around these competencies. And I'm just going to share my slide real quick with you to share this model. Let me know when you can see this. Can you see this slide here? It's loading right now. Not quite yet. There it is. I can see it. Okay.
18:09 Speaker: Great. So one of the things that Oleon, our CEO, and others are really keen to figure out is how do we ensure that here we have the best leaders, not just for now, but the best leaders for the future? Like what are we going to need to know, do, and be in the future? And how do we help bring all of us to that future? Because as we know, just from the last several years, it seems like...
18:36 Speaker: Every six months or so, there's some crazy new thing that's so-called unprecedented, right? It's like, wow, this is the thing that never happened before. So in working with Oleon and with the team, and then also we do a lot of this kind of work, and so we have a lot of research. We've gone through what's happening in your industry and what's going on around the world, and we've also looked at what we find the very best leaders doing in the past and combined that with what we heard from your senior leadership team.
19:04 Speaker: And we built this model. We call it the STAR model. And it's an acronym for strategic partner, talent enabler, agile executor, and resilient steward. So S, T, A, and R. And the idea here is that as leaders at STC, as you all, exemplify and develop these types of skills or build on your strengths, if they're already strengths that you have, then you'll be more
19:33 Speaker: prepared and better able to step into roles of greater responsibility. So what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to ask you some questions about your career and I'm going to... invite you to share examples with me that will help me kind of understand where you have interacted with these types of attributes in the past now you don't need to know this model or feel like oh i need to understand every single bit of this so i'll just ask the questions but i wanted to give you the kind of okay this is the the framework that i'm kind of basing it all on and just to get a little bit more granular here i'll show you this slide
20:10 Speaker: so within each one of these four categories the four star categories if you can see that there we've got a couple of things so like in strategic partner We're looking for individuals to be innovative and to connect or partnership well or to figure out how to simplify things from all of the complexity. In Talent Enabler, we're trying to help individuals think about how they can continue to coach, empower teams, and really hold teams accountable to elevate performance. In the Agile Executor, it...
20:43 Speaker: builds on that and says how do we then deliver results on a regular basis how do we adapt to the changing environment and then try new things through pioneering new efforts and whether they're brand new or just new in our region and area and then resilient steward this has to do with is really interesting but has to do with this idea of understanding who we are, which is something you've kind of talked about, and then figuring out how we can best serve, inspire, and then ensure resilience and sustaining the results and the approach that we're getting, just not for ourselves, but for everybody. So I'm going to ask you some questions about your career focused on this. Any questions about this model before I dive into some of those questions for you? No, it's a lot to take in, but it's pretty interesting.
21:31 Speaker: I mean, definitely shows, I think of, you know, managers and leaders that have been great, that I think it was like my favorites. And they definitely have traits that show up in this model. Okay, cool. Well, good. Well, with that in mind, then, if you can just give me a, I don't know if you can do 30 seconds, but like a 30 second to one minute.
21:55 Speaker: Hit by hit rundown of your work experience, like kind of job to job to job. I don't need to know any details yet. So this isn't where you kind of describe experiences, but just like what kind of where you started and maybe starting. Well, yeah, starting out after your undergraduate, because I know you had those graduate education experiences, but maybe starting with your when you graduate from undergrad, then what happened from there? When I graduated from undergrad, I was very much in the evolutionary biology.
22:24 Speaker: space. I had an internship at the Smithsonian and wrote my bachelor's paper on parenting behavior in old school mice in Florida. And so when I went to grad school, yeah, which is much more interesting than it sounds on the surface. It actually sounds pretty interesting. From there I went to grad school where
22:52 Speaker: kind of spent the first year trying to figure out who my advisor would be and who uh my what my focus would be ended up becoming a focus on woolly mammoth evolution um my advisor uh was one of the foremost experts on it uh and um from there after what we talked about before you know realizing that grad school wasn't for me uh i ended up going to um to over tab
23:18 Speaker: for about a year uh as i was in ann arbor trying to figure out what to do uh at the time i was dating a girl as well and you know trying to figure out what's my what's my future here and during the course of that year i decided like you know like it's not working for me here i need to be into back in a city um not that the city is the cell that heals all wounds but i was much more likely
23:40 Speaker: to be effective and to have good mental health if i was in a high density metropolitan area so i moved back to chicago uh and spent the time uh applying to law school um when i wasn't working i was working selling uh junk mail for mortgage finance company so if you ever received a letter in the mail that said like you may have qualified for our lowest interest rate yeah that was me and yeah it was it was it was great because i'd sell like 10 000 pieces of junk mail
24:08 Speaker: and then i would recycle a little slip of paper that i wrote it down on i'm like am i really am i really recycling if i generated 10 000 pieces of junk mail um but but then went to law school um got into law schools um and uh and i went to georgetown uh in dc uh which uh i was very happy about i
24:32 Speaker: I'll tell one little quip which might be helpful for this evaluation. I've never gotten into, at least for my undergraduate and my law degrees, I never attended a school that I came into without being on the wait list. So I was wait listed in college and wait listed in law school and thought I was going to school at Notre Dame in Indiana and then got in off the wait list.
24:59 Speaker: uh in in law school i tell you that's as a vehicle so i can tell this quick story yeah um i i tend to try to be funny in my essays as a way to stand out also it's it's my own it's my one way of interacting with the world and um in my first year of law school i was speaking to uh one of the admissions officers there so yeah uh we were you know having a drink as one does it's like you know in like the the central
25:25 Speaker: foyer of the law school and i said my name she said oh oh i know you i read your uh i read your uh um your application i was one of the folks reading i was like oh that's great thank you for for uh the admission she said yeah so there's two types of waitlist there's waitlist a and waitlist b i said i i don't know where this is going but okay and she said most almost every person who's admitted off the waitlist is in waitlist a
25:53 Speaker: So waitlist A are the students that are there, and we could easily swap them out if people don't matriculate. Waitlist B is a relatively larger pool, but we only dip into waitlist B if something unusual happens, like a scandal involving the school and the news where suddenly the numbers go down or an unexpected tuition hike that causes the number of people matriculating to go down. So we almost never dip in waitlist B.
26:23 Speaker: I'm curious as to why you're telling me this story, Sophia. And she said, well, you're in waitlist B. I'm like, clearly, 100% that's where you're going with the story. So you're in waitlist B. And one of the things that stood out for us is you sent your original essays and they were really funny. And then when we told you you're on the waitlist, you're given the opportunity to add more detail. And you sent three or four other essays, which were hilarious.
26:51 Speaker: And Dean Kornblatt, the dean of admissions, read these essays and looked at everyone on the table and said, you know what? We've got space. He'll be good for morale. And that's how you were given admission. And I said, well, I'm going to take this as a win. I choose to accept this as a win. Thank you, Sophia. So this is not just me trying to be funny, but also when you ask about my career path, I think this is...
27:19 Speaker: Relatively important because I have had a number of intellectual and professional interests. And one thing that has been a common thread throughout all of these is that I sometimes find myself in positions where you need to defend, maybe that's a more aggressive word, but you need to establish your value to gatekeepers. And I think, you know, after law school, I worked for legal aid in domestic violence.
27:47 Speaker: division where we represented victims of domestic violence or their children. And after being there for a number of years, which was, as you can imagine, quite heavy on the psyche, my wife and I decided that we wanted to do something else. We needed to do something else. And I had been up for a job with the State Department, which fell through.
28:13 Speaker: eventually, but we went through the whole two years of background check, or passed the background check, but still the job didn't materialize in the end. But it kind of wet our appetite for working overseas and doing something different than what I've been doing. And that's when the idea to go into infrastructure came in. So I worked for a telecom industry, but I wanted to pay cut to work in telecom, but I wanted to get out of family law, divorce law.
28:38 Speaker: Because I was working for a small, I left out, I was working for a for-profit law firm for a short period of time, but decided that for a number of reasons, it wasn't a good fit. So I went into infrastructure work and built cell towers. And for the most part, cell towers, sometimes antennas. And went to West Texas, New York City, North Dakota, kind of all over the place.
29:07 Speaker: And then got a job at Tesla, kind of doing the same thing. But instead of for cell towers, it was charging stations, supercharging stations. So I believe you said earlier you live in Utah. If you've ever driven through the Dakotas or Montana, I'm sorry, Minnesota or the Dakotas in a Tesla, you probably stopped at a development that I spearheaded.
29:37 Speaker: uh and then after uh a number of layoffs at tesla um due in part to the the lack of production of their model three we don't need to go into all this um ended up getting a job as an uh as a lobbyist an attorney for an environmental group called the natural resources defense council um and worked there for a couple of years and then and this should be the penultimate
30:06 Speaker: uh stop on our on our ridiculous ride um was talking to a friend who i had been working with on some solar development projects and wind development projects for a number of years on the side yeah um which nrdc approved they they reviewed what i did they said that's fine just don't don't build in any states where you have a lobbying license um you're registered lobbyist so talking to a friend uh about it and said like i'm pretty sure energy is gonna gonna blow up
30:34 Speaker: I'm wondering if I should switch careers and move into it. Do you know anyone who's hiring? He said, well, why don't we just come work with us and we'll keep doing what we do. Just have you do it full time instead of like a couple hours a week. I said, great. So that was in 2020. And that's when I started working in development. And to polish off the story, here's the ultimate portion of it. Been working there in that field or adjacent projects.
31:03 Speaker: since then as a consultant and developer um and still had the bug uh in our bonnet about wanting to try to live overseas uh and thought well how do i make myself look at my resume nothing here says this guy wants to live overseas this guy works on the international projects so um got the idea to look for either a degree program or other some other kind of certificate that would give that
31:29 Speaker: global, you know, um, international, uh, look. Uh, and that's how I ended up at, as you know, Chicago for, um, at Harvard, um, the global development practice program. Uh, and, uh, and that's what brought me here. Very cool. What a fun ride. And I'm sure it's a ride. Yeah. Well, and man, I, I'm glad we have another hour and 15 minutes. Cause I want to hear all about it. I just am. So it's, um,
31:59 Speaker: Very intriguing. And I think this would probably be a good time. I shared that model with you. I think let's jump in. So in strategic partner, that top, the S of the star model, there are three things, innovate, connect, and simplify. And I've already heard you talk around several of those, but let's jump into the innovate one. And I'm already kind of thinking back, even your...
32:27 Speaker: The example you gave about as a high schooler, how you found solutions given your set of circumstances and resources to solve. Can you share an example from any one of those stops along your work experience of where you challenged the status quo, you developed and then implemented something unique or different, innovative, something like that?
32:53 Speaker: So I'll give you two, and I don't know if either of these answer, but you'll tell me if they answer them. One is the reason why I left Legal Aid and worked for that full-profit law firm was the opportunity to start the family law practice. That law firm had never had a family law practice. They had a criminal law practice and an immigration law practice, never had a family law practice. And some of their clients said, all these things kind of fit together in your life.
33:22 Speaker: uh it was an opportunity to start a family law practice so i had to do the hiring um insect the staff and and build it up um so to the extent that that is innovative like that is an innovation where you're trying to bring the process to a company that's never had before but i also think that that's not quite answering the question because it seems that the question is also asking where did you have to buck a trend part of innovation
33:47 Speaker: is having to fight against an entrenched interest. And there, I'm parachuted in. Here is a firm that is happy to have a family law practice. You are stepping on nobody's toes. Nobody is harmed, unless it's like there's a queue at the copier for you doing your work. And so I think a part of innovation is not just coming up with new ideas and making them happen, but coming up with a new idea and being able to defend and or modify it.
34:17 Speaker: in the wake of stakeholder opposition and in a way that hopefully you're able to get everybody on board where you're not winning everybody's winning right like that's the goal is is innovation isn't even though it is in the face of someone else's process yeah you don't want that person or persons to feel like it's um a negative development on them and so uh what i'll argue is that when i was in telecom
34:46 Speaker: uh one of the things that we had a process for how we you know develop projects and how we account for them and it was important to me at the time that instead of just running the numbers if you have to get this many permits out we have to review this many construction drawings it was important that we were able to take accountability
35:08 Speaker: And unfortunately at the time, it was run a little bit like a factory where there was a shared email address for everybody. I'm sorry, there was not a shared email address for everybody. Everybody had their email address, but then no one was in charge of making sure that the deadlines were being met, that emails were being responded to. And because of turnover or because of the growth of the company, people being promoted to other positions.
35:35 Speaker: permits or responses were falling behind. And so one of the things I came up with was we need, we can't have individual, we can't apply under individual emails. We have to have individual emails, but all submissions for permits need to be under permits at mobility.com or whatever it was. And we need to make sure that there is an assigned person who's checking these at all times and that
36:03 Speaker: the burden of the administration of that has to be spread out amongst other people. It can't just be, Mark, this is your job, but you're being evaluated on the number of permits you get out, the number of cell towers you get built. So it has to be one that is spaced around and is given credit at review processes, at review time. And so I think that is one in which there was a lot of pushback because the pushback was that
36:31 Speaker: it would slow people down right when anytime you have that it puts it out there and also it put a number of people's submission under the microscope yeah so if you have a terrible position submission yeah right and the uh the administrator of the city or the state comes back and says like what the heck is this you know there's all kinds of things whereas before there was no one except your direct supervisor who would possibly find out about that
37:00 Speaker: But even then, the supervisor may not see it. It will just go into your email and get ignored and say, oh, sorry, permit was denied. We'll have to reapply. No one asks a question. There's no QA. But because of that, a number of people who may have emphasized quantity over quality were in opposition and took heat on it. And I think that's a situation in which these are friends, too. These are people I work with. These are people I like. And I think part of...
37:28 Speaker: leadership is working with the folks that you're innovating with, but also finding the ability and the willingness to weather an uncomfortable situation so that the processes themselves can improve. Great, great story and a very fascinating example. So what was the fallout?
37:54 Speaker: Six months, 10 to 12 months, a couple years after that, what happened? I'm really curious. Well, one of the managers got fired. Okay. It's like putting bubble gum in the box. We'll just count this as shift and we'll figure out what we shipped later on. And it wasn't just my innovations, but it was that combined with a number of other issues. But I think it did help because
38:24 Speaker: the ability now to i think the best way it helped that was unforeseen was we were then able to hand off projects much more easily it wasn't just that there was accountability um or that the stuff would be replied to in a more timely manner which is the main reason but also it meant that when people moved to other jobs or when regions had to be consolidated okay mark you're in charge of new jersey now yeah you know rebecca now you're in charge of new jersey and connecticut well now you're not looking for
38:53 Speaker: What did Mark do? What did Rebecca do? It's one email inbox. We've all got access to it. Go find out what's in there. And I think that was a part of it is it made the meta process of rearrangement within the company a lot easier. Cool. I love it. So what you'll see as I go through these elements of the model, they all interact and kind of correlate with each other.
39:21 Speaker: So the next one's very close, going from innovation to then connect. So connecting, partnering, building relationships. I'd love to hear. And again, you can pick a story from any one of, you know, anywhere in your experience. But can you share a time with me where you were able to really reach out and build relationships? And I would particularly be interested on a story of when maybe it was.
39:48 Speaker: there was a pre-existing difficult relationship or there was some barrier to building relationship and you were able to then kind of work your way through that and and build some strong relationships yeah i i've got one uh i hope it's uh i hope it's not too strange is when i was a divorce lawyer okay um you know the when you are in any kind of contentious legal action activity building bridges is incredibly hard because part of the adversarial system
40:16 Speaker: is to smash the bridges right in a way you are ethically required to be a zealous advocate and that means that sometimes you carry a hammer around uh and not a building hammer but like a breaking hammer right in terms of relationships which is fine right especially given the nature you know the the abusive nature of some of these relationships i was in like it was a he was part of my job to take the heat all right so that my client didn't have to you know didn't have to um that sounds hard but but yeah it is hard um
40:46 Speaker: And I think that it's also, maybe nonsensically, a problem, especially when there are kids of them. And that when you have families that are divorcing or splitting apart, the ability to work for the sake of the kids is really important. And you're also trying to come up with an agreement when the two parties are at the most adversarial they're going to be. The hurt of the split up maybe is still raw.
41:13 Speaker: um the maybe they're still living together maybe they're not living together but someone's living in their mom's garage right like it's the the odds of it being very very stressful are through the roof and so one of the parts of connection that i think is important is trying to remind people whether implicitly or explicitly about their shared humanity yeah right like you may not like this you may never like this person again but these children are gonna have to be in your lives for a bit how do we make this and
41:43 Speaker: i'm going to tell you a trick uh i use and i'll say it's a trick i i think there's good scientific backing for it but whenever i had a negotiation as long as there wasn't a risk of physical abuse it's physical abuse that's different like we got to keep people separate right but as long as there's not that um one of the tricks i had is when you'd have to have a negotiation conference with the other attorney and yourself two parties yeah um i would always order food warm food
42:11 Speaker: and leave it in the negotiation with anyone when you're negotiating. I tried to have it in my office. And preferably a food that you have to break apart. Garlic bread, just a loaf of bread that you've got to break apart. Some other kinds of food that require you to interact with someone else. And the parties will all be sitting there. And my paralegal will be sitting there, or one of my assistants, my law student.
42:40 Speaker: And before we start, I'll say, would everyone mind? I have to go to the bathroom. I have to get a cup of coffee. I need to call my family for a minute, and then I'll leave for 10 minutes. I'll say, I apologize. Please bear with me. Leave for 10 minutes. And 8 out of 10 times, someone, including my paralegal, because I usually plant them to do it, will start passing food around while we wait. We'll start handing food around while we wait.
43:09 Speaker: Even if they don't talk, because everyone, again, tensions are high. Even if they don't talk, the act of sharing a human connection, even with someone you hate, passing them food, being passed food to them helps. Putting some food in their stomach helps. And the fact that we, being one of the attorneys, is not coming in guns blazing also changes it, too. Because there is an incentive.
43:37 Speaker: for attorneys particularly in family law cases to come in and look like the most aggressive people i'm your bulldog yeah i'm gonna fight for you there are two kids involved right you don't want a bulldog in the same room as an aggressive bulldog in the same room as kids yeah um and so that is i think one way in which we have had to build bridges even if they're going to fight forever about the ira or about the retirement 401k account if we can get to the point where enough shared humanity is there
44:06 Speaker: where their regard for their kids, or at least their feigned regard for their kids, because there's a lot of narcissists out there. But you need them to at least feel like they have to pretend to be a good parent. And it's that shared humanity that gets everyone a little closer to that page. Man, that's so powerful. That was a great example. Thank you for sharing. And actually...
44:30 Speaker: I've learned something here. So I'm going to, if you don't mind, I might take that trick and use it if I'm ever in this. You should, you should, you should always use it. Like feed people ahead of time. Yeah. Every negotiation goes better. Yeah. When I love that you would get up and go, how did you figure that out? Like what, was that obvious to you or did that just happen serendipitously once or how did you figure out that idea of like stepping away and letting them do that without you in the room?
44:58 Speaker: I found that it was a little bit more organic because if I'm sitting there, like everyone knows that I'm an attorney and it's my office. So if I'm sitting there and I'm like handing people food, no one's hackles comes down because they're like, we're working now. Every party member needed is present. So we're working, right? And so when people are working, their hackles are up. But if people don't know the game has started, if people don't know the whistle's been blown, they're not going to get into the starting position, right?
45:27 Speaker: they're not going to put their batting gloves on the game hasn't started yet yeah and that's what i needed i needed both the parties and honestly the attorneys to not believe that the game has started yet okay um now a savvy attorney will know that the game has started yeah but the parties won't and um and even if they do hey man there's free garlic knots like you know what are you gonna get to say no to garlic knots come on yeah uh and uh and so that's where it was
45:54 Speaker: You need at least one element to be missing to feel like an organic interaction because otherwise it looks like a play. But if I'm not there, if the director's not there, the odds of it feeling like a play are lower. That is so interesting. So kind of thinking about this connection idea, and it doesn't need to be as detailed as that one, but do you have a...
46:18 Speaker: a way that you've been able to connect i know that like when you talked about the development work you've been doing whether the the more recent work um or what you were doing before can you just touch on how you how you go about building partnerships when maybe one doesn't exist like reaching out and saying hey we've got a we've you know we need to begin working together so initiating a partnership i mean i think you know it's soft sales 101 in a way
46:45 Speaker: uh where i can wait too if you're right no you're good sorry i just want to make sure that there wasn't somebody who had reserved this room so keep right uh but it's soft sales right where you know you have to be honest hey look like if i'm if i'm a developer look i'm calling out after mobility we want to develop that uh we need we need a cell tower that we need a cell antenna there um part of it is that right just being honest because people don't want to bait and switch you really lose credibility if
47:15 Speaker: people find out eight minutes later it's a sales call right um or a negotiation call they need to be told about it yeah but the other part of it is um i think when you're trying to like make a connection um and this is hard for you right for me right now because part of my job is i gotta answer you right as part of this position but normally i'd ask you to talk about yourself yeah a lot more because you ideally in any
47:43 Speaker: of those bridge building conversations, I should be listening about twice as much as I speak. Yeah. Because you don't learn when you're speaking. You only learn about someone who's talking. And as I think you find out the course of this work today, when people are allowed to explain themselves or to express their feelings.
48:07 Speaker: their guard goes down and their ability to be honest is there. Do you need to... There's a window to this room. I apologize. I keep looking up. There's just like a huge crowd of students. And I was nervous that they were patiently waiting for me to leave the room. But it looks like most of them are gone now. So I think we're good. Okay, we're good. So what do you mean? If there's a mob outside or a boycott or some kind of military action, please feel free to let me go. We can change it. But the...
48:35 Speaker: But that connection is partly from listening. Speaking is important, right? But the best speakers are the best listeners because they've already listened to what needs and thought about what needs to be said. And I think that that's the big part of the connection. There was one call I had with Yolanda, the Department of Finance of New York City. I called up because we needed a permit because we were putting up a couple of antennas on some towers in Manhattan.
49:05 Speaker: outside the towers on a couple of buildings in manhattan wow um and i said i'm here for mobility and she said mobility i know you guys you still owe us four thousand dollars from the fees from your last uh antenna i was like give me one moment please and i had to go check the mobility the company had been incorporated before mobility b we were mobility c totally new company yeah right mobility b had been folded up and sold to someone else
49:33 Speaker: um sold to one of our competitors actually crown castle um and we had failed to pay that and then pass that on to crown castle crown castle just ignored um when it was their project but yolanda was mad at me because it said on all the paperwork mobility yeah i'm my business card says mobility and i can't convince her not credible that's not us that's not us now
50:00 Speaker: We are not that mobility. You got to talk to these other guys. So part of that is honestly listening to her saying like, Hey, what's, what do we need? What stresses is causing you in your job? Right. Because for her, it's not just me convincing her. I'm going to, one of my time as a lobbyist, I'm going to reveal a little bit, a little, I don't know, it's a nugget or a, an operating principle that I had. Your goal when you speak to someone is not to convince them that what you want is a good idea.
50:29 Speaker: yeah that's not your goal your goal is to convince them that the people they report to will think it's a good idea and that they will not incur any negative outcomes if they go along with your idea and that maybe they might be uh able to receive positive outcomes if it goes to not is this a good idea for the community or for you know the company and people care that a little bit but their number one goal is to make sure that their job their family
50:59 Speaker: is safe like their income is safe and so your job is not to convince them that this is a good idea you're talking to convince them that their boss the voters their clients whoever it is that they're answering to um will be will think that's will appreciate the the the choice they made and so in this case with yolanda my job is not to convince her not to find us my job is to see like what the pushback is yeah is it showing up on her spreadsheet every week
51:28 Speaker: and her boss is constantly saying like why is there a four thousand dollar like find out what happened to these guys yeah right and i i kind of sussed out that that's what it was and i said you know let me see what i can do about it to my boss and stuff like i think we need to cut them a check for four thousand dollars he was like no no no we sold that company uh that's the company that owes them i was like yeah but i got 98 antennas in manhattan that we got to get up and that's hundreds of thousands of dollars
51:58 Speaker: in in fees in like in work that we need done and it's probably in the millions in terms of what our client is going to pay us and if yolanda doesn't get that red highlighter the highlighted cell out of her spreadsheet every week when she talks to a boss we ain't getting those permits yeah i was like all right and we cut the check right yeah uh and uh we got our permits and our antennas went up
52:25 Speaker: I'm in New York City. And I think that's part of it is it's not just convincing someone about the rightness of your position or that it's listening and trying to evaluate what their needs and pressures are. Beautiful story. Thank you. I'm going to jump now to simplicity. And it's interesting because this is, well, I mean. I'm the wrong dude. Innovation and connect. And then we go.
52:52 Speaker: We go simplicity and it's not just like making it that, you know, not just dumbing down something or saying it in just two words, but it's the idea here is the ability to reduce complexity because often complexity gets in the way. And I think your story, just so you know where I'm coming from, I think your story of saying let's pay the $4,000 is an example of simplicity as much as it is an example of partnering because it's like,
53:21 Speaker: okay, what's the highest priority? How do we just cut through this all and get to where we need to get? Or others probably wouldn't see it that way. It sounds like your boss did in the beginning. So, I mean, you say you're not my guy. I'd love to hear why you think that, but then just tell me about kind of an experience where you felt like there was a lot of stuff going on and you were able to kind of create some clear priorities in all of that and make life easier for everybody to get their work done.
53:52 Speaker: Yeah, that's a good question. I think I'm trying to think through because simplicity is funny. Simplicity is a tool. Yeah. Right. You're not going to simplicity for simplicity. What you're really looking for is effectiveness. Right. And any extraneous processes, any extraneous, you know, folks on the email chain, like all of that get in the way of efficiency, sometimes dramatically. Yeah. In the way of efficiency. And.
54:21 Speaker: and i think probably you know the the the main one being one or two um is that when i was in wild opening to a sentence uh when i was in siberia collecting woolly mammoth tusks that is awesome that's a wild sentence the one of the things when we were in a small town in russia called hatanga it's in the north of the arctic circle
54:50 Speaker: on the thiamir peninsula wow and it's maybe a few hundred few hundred people right uh maybe a few maybe a couple of grand because it used to be a military base and there's a train depot there uh but there's not that many folks there and it's in the middle of kind of nowhere it's in the middle of the the tundra and the tiger yeah yeah and uh we the reason i'm bringing this up is that there was some animosity from local folks most of them weren't russian most of them were local uh ethnic group called the dogon
55:20 Speaker: there's some animosity from local folks for us being there because it was mostly americans dutch and germans western western western scientists coming in there and trying to collect mammoths and so some wild stories came out you know they're exporting the tusks the to be sold as jewelry right they are um one of my favorites was uh they when they take because you find frozen mammoth in the permafrost sometimes like mammoth like with flesh on it right uh one of yeah we had we had a couple of them right in fact
55:49 Speaker: If you're ever bored, you look up a Discovery Channel story about woolly mammoths finding the mammoth or raising the mammoth with a professor named Dan Fisher that was my advisor. There's a bunch of them out there. But anyway, there's a couple of almost whole mammoths that we pulled out of the permafrost. And the rumor circulated that these Westerners were actually selling the mammoth meat.
56:17 Speaker: to millionaire westerners as a delicacy so they could try them i'm like you know it's one of those things where you can't you can go around and try to uh try to fight this right or you can ignore it and just let like the resentment build up um but another option and a more simple option a much more effective option is to just walk around the town and talk to people right buy your bread
56:45 Speaker: the same place everyone else buys their bread right don't have it shipped to the lab go send a dude usually me because that was the scrum yeah but send a dude out like talk to people and you'll find that and again in this place it's it's kind of a human connection element again but it's one case where you could you could undertake whatever the post-soviet equivalent of a pr campaign would be or you can just remind people that you just explain what you're doing yeah and
57:15 Speaker: Just explain in a small town like that. You explain to three people you've explained to 30 because they're all going to talk to people. Right. And then you wait three days. They've now explained to 90. And that is the most and especially if you are unusual, which we were, which I am, especially in that area. And if you're memorable and if you're kind, those things go uncannily long way in.
57:42 Speaker: in building relationships and making your life much less complicated. I guess one thing that's emerging probably from this is a central philosophy of mine, which is that in addition to logistic processes that need to be made efficient, it's the humans that execute those processes that need to be made efficient. And that's that efficiency is dramatically assisted if you can build an element of trust.
58:10 Speaker: amongst the principles involved fantastic um so there's like this human element and i'm curious i want to go back like why would you have said i'm not your guy like why what was what was going on in your head like tell me i mean you're probably just joking but like tell me tell me about like is there something about simplicity that you feel uncomfortable with or you prefer not to like or is this like yeah that's not my thing
58:36 Speaker: No, when we talk about process simplicity, yes. When we're talking about verbal simplicity, I've never used three words when eight would suffice. Okay. So, you can probably tell, right? Like, you're talking about this. Yeah. And I could easily run over time. Okay. And I think that comes across. I suspect it comes across when we're talking. Like, it doesn't take a whole lot to prime the engine.
59:03 Speaker: for this car, right? Like it just starts going. Cool. Well, I mean, I'm having fun here, so I appreciate that. Tell me about, I just want to dig in a little bit on process. If you were to, if you're in a situation where you're like, oh, I could choose a job where I'm doing people interaction, like walking around, buying bread and talking with the folks in Siberia.
59:31 Speaker: versus your advisors like, or you could work on trying to make this process for documenting everything we're doing more efficient and like cross the T's and dot the I's. Is there one you would prefer? Which direction would you kind of prefer to go? It's going to sound like a cop-out answer, but I promise it's not. I think I would be fine with either one. Okay. Because in both cases, you're trying to solve a problem.
01:00:00 Speaker: yeah and in both case like in the in the case of you know the efficiency where it's all the process that requires a lot more human reaction than probably we think okay right particularly you know you sit down you sit down with folks for two hours and try to figure out what makes them tick right yeah the equivalent happens the people who designed or have to live with those processes it is very ineffective to just parachute in and say i see a whole bunch of inefficiencies all of you get out of the way i'm going to clean it up
01:00:29 Speaker: uh please cut the check uh to uh to anderson consulting right that's not going to work right it's it if it effective um process improvement is requires the buy-in and input of the people you're dealing with who will implement it or have to suffer the consequences and in the same way when you walk around and interact with people that's not it's as way the job should be it's not merely
01:00:55 Speaker: I'm going to go talk to people. There is an element of analysis required. Who is the big man or woman in town? What will get me on their good side? Or how can I convince them that we're good folks, like we're not bad folks, right? Who are the people in town that other people avoid? Because there is guilt by association. If I become close buddy-buddy with a local drug dealer, I'm not going to be well appreciated in town.
01:01:25 Speaker: And if I'm unaware of the local reindeer festival, if I'm unaware of local norms, right, then I'm just walking around for my own self aggrandizement, right? To be effective at the job, if you're doing a job like that, a public-facing job, you have to have a level of analysis, strategy, and you have to be able to communicate with your team if you work on why you're doing what you're doing. Listen, I'm going to go out there. It's going to look like I'm just talking about fishing.
01:01:54 Speaker: with sasha and and uh and pjot yeah but i'm not pjot's father is the mayor of town right and sasha is the local priest there's only one restaurant with an actual priest in town and he's a good guy and him giving us the imprimatur pun intended uh goes a long way towards establishing our credibility yeah here um so i think there's a level of analysis in the human interaction that's required in execution
01:02:22 Speaker: I think it's a level of human interaction that is required to effectively do the analyses. I love it. Brilliant. Okay, we're going to move on to the next element, which is about this idea of talent enablement. And I'm going to take it all in one fell swoop because I think, again, these cross over a lot. But if you can share some experiences or stories of how you have coached others,
01:02:52 Speaker: how you've built and empowered teams, and ultimately helped teams to accelerate their ability to achieve performance. I think there's a lot that you've already touched on, so feel free to reach back to some of those things you've already talked about and refer to them. Because I've already heard a lot that you've said that addresses that. But anything you want to share there? Yeah. Yeah, there's one story that I think I like. I know I like it. I was...
01:03:18 Speaker: in charge of a small team when i was in telecom i think three or four people okay and my boss had none normally to report to him but he had his own team too that they were they were applying stuff and he had a tremendous conflict with one of his uh with one of his reporting lines one of his employees um where they couldn't stand each other and she was as he told it and as i observed not working hard coming in late like not being a very effective team member at all
01:03:47 Speaker: And he was like, I'm thinking about just letting her go because we can't. She's actually a negative drain on us. And I said, all right, how about this? Give me a month or two. I can't remember this. One or two months. Have a report to me. I need the help, and you're going to get rid of her anyway. And let's see if we can turn this around. I think you did a great job, but sometimes it just needs a different personality type. And he was like, all right, you want to do it? Take it. So you transferred to me.
01:04:15 Speaker: And I sat her down the very first before we talked. I said, listen, I don't know what's going on with you and Mark, the other Mark. I don't know what's going on with you and Mark. But as far as I'm concerned, like I've interacted with you a bunch. You're very intelligent. You clearly know what you're doing when you are negotiating these contracts on the phone. And I am going to make a guess that what you really need is you really need a manager to lay off you.
01:04:45 Speaker: You need someone that just lets you do what you know how to do. And she said, you know, thank you. I appreciate that. I'm going to tell you. I did not know that. But I was taking a calculated guess that we have intelligent people and they clash. Sometimes one of the things that you need, particularly when they've been having a conflict with their manager over minute processes, is the best medicine for a sore.
01:05:15 Speaker: is to let it air out. Sometimes the best medicine for an over-micro, over-managed relationship is to under-manage it for a little bit. And so I said, you know, I'm going to trust you. I don't care at all how you do your job. I don't care if you leave or come back. You need to go out and have a smoke. You need to go out and have a coffee. I don't care. All I care about, and I know you can deliver it, which is why I'm telling you, you have free reign.
01:05:44 Speaker: is i just want the numbers at the end of the week i want to know that the applications you put in weren't out there i want to know that if there's any hearings or the like that we need to attend that we've got them handled um beyond that i'm not i don't care what your job i'm not gonna tell you how to do your job i'm just gonna tell you what the results i want are yeah you can always come to me if you need help like i'll sit with you all day long right um to help you with stuff but i'm not gonna pretend
01:06:12 Speaker: Like, I can do a better job than you. You have to come tell me. I need to tell. And she said, thank you. I appreciate that. It took a little bit, a couple of few weeks to settle into it. But to be quite honest with you, she was very effective at what she did when she did it. And was she the best we had? No. Was she the worst? Absolutely not.
01:06:39 Speaker: And a big part of it was not only setting the stage for her, but here's the second part. I think this is probably just as important. Because I sat the team down. Now we had four people. I sat the team down and said, look, we just inherited a pile. We inherited a pile of permits that didn't go through because the previous guy was laid off. This relates to a previous story about a guy kind of fudging his numbers a little bit. And so we've been tasked to fix this. So we've got a lot of applications we've got to make.
01:07:08 Speaker: uh if we're going to meet the construction deadlines for these polls uh and here's what we're a team here all right like no one in this team gets any grief from anyone outside this team all negative actions if we don't hit the numbers if someone comes back pissed off because we sent the wrong construction drawing um none of it falls on any of you three it only falls on me if we do well all the credit will go to you and the reason i want you to do this
01:07:34 Speaker: is i want you to do what you do best which is use your intelligence and use your initiative and get the crap done that needs to get done and don't worry that you're going to be thrown under the bus don't worry about making a mistake make as many mistakes as you want get it get the stuff out there um and you know be you do your best uh we had i think two or three
01:07:57 Speaker: months in a row uh not that i think quantitative measures are the best for this kind of thing but we had by far the largest number of permit applications sent um from any of the teams for like two or three or four months something like that and to the point where mark my manager was like i don't know what you did to get her uh the lady in question is i don't know what you did to get her working but uh but but she was working um and so this is my way of the reason i'm telling this story
01:08:27 Speaker: is when we're talking about unlocking talent, sometimes what we think of as effective work is actually just us evaluating what it looks like. If you ask me what does a handsome man look like, the odds of me just holding up a picture of myself might be very high. Like this is what a handsome guy looks like. If you can't be aware that there are other types of handsome out there, if you can't be aware that there are other types of effectiveness, it is very hard to...
01:08:56 Speaker: To succeed because the odds of someone working exactly like you do if your manager are low So and also if you don't have hiring or firing power, which I did not right If you don't have hiring power, you got it You have to cook with the ingredients that they put in your fridge, right? Like you don't have a choice Yeah, you'd want you want a better cut of steak, but listen you got beanie weenies in there So you're gonna have to you're gonna have to make dinner with those beanie weenies and
01:09:24 Speaker: And part of that is trying to listen and figure out what is not only effective for people, but also what gives them the chance to grow into what effectiveness could mean for them. I think those all combine really well. Like all of that whole story combines really well to help me think about kind of better understand your approach as a coach, as somebody who's empowering and building teams and elevating.
01:09:53 Speaker: And I really did appreciate actually that you shared the quantitative stuff, at least just kind of like, oh, we got more permits and that sort of thing. Because I think that's helpful as well. Because I mean, everybody always cares about results. Did you ever, in using that approach, whether in that team or with other teams that you've led, have you ever had somebody kind of take advantage of the freedom or of the trust that you are giving them and kind of, I guess, end up...
01:10:22 Speaker: really not delivering and you having to take some heat that you wouldn't have otherwise to take? Yeah. In this particular, I'll tell two quick stories. The first one is this one, where she was actually not consistent, right? There'd be whole weeks where she would be, the employee in question, where she wouldn't be very effective. But she did go through bursts of productivity and effectiveness, and it was contributed to by a lot of factors.
01:10:51 Speaker: Uh, but, um, but I did take heat because there were times where she was clearly not doing her job. Right. Um, like she's clearly like just sitting around on her phone all day. And in those cases, you know, for the numbers, she never popped up as a problem in the numbers in part, because the way I tried to structure it was no one takes any heat on negative numbers. You said me, right. If the numbers are, if the numbers are low or not, I mean our targets, you don't see a breakdown. You will not see a breakdown for me.
01:11:20 Speaker: about who did what um but if the numbers are good you'll see a breakdown because then at least one if not more of my team members look good um and so in a way some of her inefficiencies are masked by that policy yeah um but it's also hard to hide it was an open office plan so like there's we had no walls it was just like desks out right it's hard to hide that she was just kind of screwing around sometimes and um and in those cases
01:11:48 Speaker: you know you have a choice to make as a leader because when you're a leader you're still not the leader right very few people are yeah everybody's accountable to somebody yeah right and um part of it is effective leadership down requires effective leadership up which means that like look i'm gonna go to this you're my boss i'll say look you know justin um people are complaining i know you complained to me about you know uh what shauna is is doing and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna ask her
01:12:18 Speaker: What I'm planning to do is I'm planning to ask her on your phone. It's okay. They need you to go outside because I can't have you setting a negative example for everyone else. But I will tell you. 
01:14:31 Speaker: the project goes off without a hitch it's already a failed plan yeah right so it requires not only building in some you don't you don't want a sandbag but it requires building in a little bit of time a little bit of money a little bit of whatever of a question so that when the inevitable problems happen it doesn't throw you off your game um and more importantly it requires a decision to be made and the decision to be made before you start the project which is i am okay if things go awry
01:14:59 Speaker: I am okay. The amount of grace you have as a person, not just as an employee or professional or a leader, but the amount of grace you have as a person is almost entirely determined by what you do when things have gone off the rail. Your grace is not when things are going well. Your grace is displayed in what you do when stuff goes pear-shaped. And this isn't even pear-shaped.
01:15:25 Speaker: Just a little walk down the hall. It wasn't even an issue. Well, thank you for your grace. Yeah. Thank you for yours. Because you're being very flexible as well. So thank you for that. You're kind. Well, and you were just saying that with this...
01:15:44 Speaker: With this lady, you would say, hey, I need you to, if you're going to look at your phone, you need to go outside so that we're not setting a bad example. I think that's where it was kind of when I got kicked out. Well, that's why I told my boss. And that's correct. Like, you know, he's like, that's what I'm going to tell you. But I'm like, but the numbers are good. You cannot, this is me talking to my boss. You cannot complain about the numbers, right? He's like, all right. It's like, okay, so whatever preconceived notion you have that she is not a good member of my team, I would like you to abandon them. Because she is a good member of my team, a great member of my team. In fact, one of the things she does better.
01:16:13 Speaker: that almost anyone else is when crunch time comes, like at the end of the month or whatever our recording period is, there's almost no one I have here that can get more done at an acceptable level of quality as she can. She may have problems before crunch time, right? But at crunch time, she's great and we need her because there are times when stuff goes pear-shaped and we end up having to do more, respond more, or someone's irritated about something. So I said, you need to make sure that you lay off her. And the boss is like,
01:16:43 Speaker: All right, but you have to talk to her because we can't have her doing this around. I pulled her aside and I said, listen, I'm getting heat, but I want the heat. I do not mind taking heat for you because you're a great employee. And I repeat to her what I said to the guy, like, there's nobody here who gets as much done when push comes to shove as you. And so I absolutely do not want to lose you as an employee. And I told him that you are very important to me. But what I need you from, what I want from you is.
01:17:11 Speaker: If you are having a day where you don't feel like working or your head's not in, your headspace is not in it, you have two choices. You either go home and call and say, which is okay, I'm never going to give you a decree for that. You may not have a PTO, but you're never going to get heat from me if you want to call in. Or you set up a call with me, like a conference call with me or a training call with me, a coaching call with me, whatever it is, and we go sit in one of the conference rooms for like four hours.
01:17:40 Speaker: And we just work. And maybe you're not effective, but now you're not being effective in front of other people. And we can get work done there too. We can also do it like as a team. I can go grab the other two folks in the team. We go sit in the conference room together because we all know how valuable you are. So if you're having a rough day, we'll cover for you. And Justin, I'll tell you this. People, not everybody.
01:18:10 Speaker: but people tend to rise to what they think your expectations of them are and they tend to drop what they think your expectations of them are and when i tell her she's amazing she will behave at her most amazing rate i can't take credit for it but something like she had the capacity to be amazing and if you tell her like that's you know that's what i expect out of you more often than not she'll rise to the occasion and if you if you come in frustrated and be like you're doing this again
01:18:39 Speaker: we talked about this i don't want to have to have this conversation again or there'll be problems you're you are not you're only setting them up to hide their ineffectiveness you're not setting them up to become more effective maybe some people do maybe some people respond to that but i i don't know many and i i'm not good at it yeah right um so um so yeah i think those are the case the other story i'm going to tell you
01:19:06 Speaker: is one in which we had a, it is a very slightly different story. I had a reporting line to me was being inappropriate with some of the ladies at a work function. Like after there's a little bit of drinking, like nothing, no touching, but still like not appropriate. And that's cool. I'm going to say, look, man, you're great, but you know, you know that we can't have this. And, you know, you talk to HR. I will vouch for you as an employee.
01:19:35 Speaker: like as effective you are but i'm not going to cover for that because i'm not going to make other people feel unsafe i didn't say it that i didn't didn't quite say it that way yeah but the gist was you know i am not going to go to bat for you in this i'm not going to throw you under the bus but i'm not going to go to that for you um and this and um and you know because your your job 
 Okay. And you were in the middle of saying that people step up to expectations when you just expect them. Is that where you were at? Or did you go beyond that? That's right. And people step up when you give them...
01:26:16 Speaker: The idea that did the belief that they that you know that they can step up. Yeah, right? And again, it's not everybody and it may not be to the level that you need them to step up to because there is there is a ceiling that is in some people right about how much they can How much they can work, you know, how good they are as a friend or as a match partner as an employee, you know, whatever it might be But you give them and yourself the best chance to get the most out of them if you
01:26:45 Speaker: monitor you you pay attention right you don't just walk away because that also is not effective but if you can give them the chance um to step up and you know and especially probably one of the things did my notes just leave i don't know okay i think it did but we're gonna try we're gonna try this
01:27:17 Speaker: Sorry for the chaos with this. Give me one more minute and hopefully this will be... Take your time. On the one hand, I'm glad we're getting the kicks out of the way now, but on the other hand, it's never fun to...
01:27:46 Speaker: throw off the pace of the meeting with something like this. I'm pretty easygoing when it comes to this. You are. I worry when I do it to others, but I'm pretty chill, so this is good. All right, we're back, baby. We're back in business. So, yeah, so the people will rise to what you expect them to go to and lower. And there's plenty of other things involved. They have to have the resources.
01:28:16 Speaker: They have to have adequate pay, adequate computer support, adequate whatever it is, the tools they need to do their job. But it's not just a matter of correction or of faith.
01:28:46 Speaker: this agile execution. So, and again, these all interweave with each other. This one's about being able to deliver and kind of help achieve goals like you were just talking about, but also managing change. So sometimes we're in the middle of a space and it's just like suddenly something happens and we didn't expect it and we have to deal with the change. So I'd love to hear examples of pretty significant change that you've had to help
01:29:16 Speaker: teams manage through how you have managed change as a team leader to help people you know begin to do or work or interact in a different way than they have in the past and or large system changes as well could be something you could touch on uh yeah i've got um one i think one i'll tell you is when i was working in um telecom 20 how a lot of my time in telecom was not
01:29:45 Speaker: It was a number of years, but it wasn't the large one. But it's probably the one where I had the most people reporting to me. So that's probably why it's showing up here. The anecdotes more than not. But one is that we had a database where we kept our notes and our files for this. And the company decided the previous database we had was inadequate, which it was. It was inadequate. And so they decided to launch.
01:30:15 Speaker: a new database and that went poorly like incredibly poorly um because the it was soft launched but we turned into it way too quickly so that we could stop paying the license on the old um the database yeah um and so my team members and myself had to deal with missing notes we had to deal with the the date ticker system not working we had to deal with a permission system
01:30:43 Speaker: that allowed people in the new system, it allowed anyone with editor access to alter any of the other notes. Not that people were going in and intentionally doing it, but there was one where I was dealing with Secaucus, New Jersey, and I had probably seven or eight pages of notes about how to deal with these guys because they were very difficult to deal with. And a contract attorney who you get hired to fill in for some capacity issues.
01:31:11 Speaker: uh went in and wrote his notes but he didn't append them he just erased mine uh and and my team members dealt with the same thing and in that case i think when you're dealing with negative change there is there are a number of very natural human tendencies one is to get angry another is to find the people to blame and those are both okay those are normal human tendencies like you have one ever since you do that
01:31:40 Speaker: uh in addition to those you you also need to not lose the thread you you can't you know let the setback part of resilience is not allowing the setbacks to prevent you from from staying on target you might be slower to get to your target but it cannot be that you are now going in a different direction yeah right it is very easy to be deflected from your target goal because gosh mike bought the worst software
01:32:09 Speaker: update in the history of the world and you shouldn't have done it and that's all true yeah that's all true but someone resources have to be still applied to making sure that you're getting the documentation out you're responding to the subpoenas you're responding to other attorneys who are trying to negotiate with you and i think that's a case where and i'll say myself but also as part of the team of folks who are managing other folks you know there's a collective desire like look we can complain about
01:32:38 Speaker: you know, all these problems in the database all day. And we should, you know, we should bear in mind that those complaints are real, but it's still May 17th. We have 14 days and we have to get these applications out if we're going to get the towers built or the antenna built by the end of the summer. And, um, and I think when you're in a leadership position and not even like official leadership, but when you're in a leadership position,
01:33:06 Speaker: Your behavior rubs off what everyone around you if they're panicking and pissed and looking for someone to blame Yeah, it's partly because you have been panicking and pissed and looking for someone to blame and I say leadership Also to drive home another point which comes very clear in these kinds of stress of situations where there's been external Disturbances and the company's been thrown off of its normal course a leadership position should reflect or magnify
01:33:36 Speaker: the existing esteem and leadership that that person holds within the company. If your leadership is based entirely on your title, you actually do not have any leadership. You actually do not have any authority. The official authority you have should reflect and magnify what others already know or will already know about working with you. And it's in those stressful situations that you see, if you're paying attention,
01:34:03 Speaker: who the person is that will be good to have in charge because he or she will be staying calm. They might be angry, but they will be staying calm and they will be focused and they will make the people around them, even the people who screwed up, they will make them work to fix the problem at a high level of effectiveness. Yeah. And so...
01:34:27 Speaker: In your work then, and I think that's a really good example of the kind of facing a systems challenge. It wasn't a good change. It wasn't done appropriately and knowing how to help people through that. Would you say that you have been, like, would you consider yourself more of a pioneer? Somebody who's out there saying, hey, let's try to integrate new technology and do new things. Or would you say you're more...
01:34:55 Speaker: You're more somebody who would say, hey, let's really kind of refine what we've got and focus on really getting good at what we've got. I know that's kind of a generic general statement, but where would you put yourself? It's a good question. If I'm being honest, I'm more of the latter. In large part, not because I mind the pioneering position, but as a source of...
01:35:23 Speaker: entrepreneurial innovation, which is what I'll call it. There's some people you know, and they're just a font of ideas. They're constantly cranking out. They're constantly cranking out ideas, right? One of my business partners is like this. If you want to call with him, try to talk about Project A, by the end of the call, he will have birthed the seeds of Projects B, C, and D, right? As the nature of the call is. So I'm not like that. I like to run a project to
01:35:51 Speaker: to its conclusion, hopefully a successful one, and make it more effective along the way. In a lot of ways, the skill sets we're talking about having that I seem to have, I think are conducive to both. But I think a lot of times the people who are the pioneers have to be, no, they don't have to be, but they tend to be the people who came up with the ideas themselves.
01:36:17 Speaker: and that as a my role could be for that person to champion their ideals and carry it sometimes i have to be the spokesman for that person sometimes the person that is the pioneer is not the one that has to champion the pioneering innovation yeah um and in that case in that particular case um i could be in what you call the pioneering subset um but in part that's because i'm filling in a gap that the the innovator doesn't necessarily have
01:36:46 Speaker: which is the ability to talk to a board for three hours without having, without passing out or needing a glass of water, which is not an easy, which is not a skill set that replicates itself very easily across a number of people. So does that answer your question? Yeah, it does. And I'm curious, like, so part of, part of this idea, and again, we're kind of in this, we're in this category of agile execution. Part of this is, is figuring out metrics and numbers and,
01:37:16 Speaker: You know, like this metric leads to this metric and kind of calculating all that stuff. Is that kind of where do you prefer to spend your time when it comes to thinking about numbers, scorecards, metrics? What are some of your what are some examples from your career around that stuff and where you would rather, you know, is it like you're just saying, hey, I'm probably not going to be the first one to come up with all the ideas, but I am definitely championing those ideas.
01:37:44 Speaker: um where would you be with metrics i'm going to give a cop-out answer but again it's a sincere one okay it depends on where the metrics are coming from it's fair i think if there are if they are what we i will call good quality metrics that is they're based off good quality surveys good quality decision data um acquisition um i really enjoy working with those because like you can really see
01:38:11 Speaker: What's happening and what needs doing, you know, depending on the tool you're using, it's using Excel You know, that's one thing at one point in my life I was much more effective with SQL than I am now But like you can you can you can run numbers and figure out like a lot of gaps and that's that's really enjoyable. Yeah, but but in Too many cases the data is not very good. Yeah, particularly in human interactions like this, right? Like sometimes especially when you have a
01:38:40 Speaker: When you have more than four people gathering the data, man, you better have like a system in place. Because in my previous life as a behavioral ecologist, the amount of spread between the way someone codes mouse or baboon behavior and the way another person codes mouse or baboon behavior is very wide. And if you are not very careful, your analyses will be showing in large part an artifact of who was recording on those days.
01:39:08 Speaker: to me when we talk about metrics i think sometimes there is a tendency not to over rely on them because that that makes it look like i don't like metrics yeah but to not to put the kind of weight on metrics that we should have um i want to know for example if i'm if i'm analyzing it i want to know like how how is this collected who collected it before we look at my team and evaluate my team i want to know that i have faith in it or that i don't in the collection methodology
01:39:37 Speaker: Uh, because if, if we don't have good collection methodology, then we're not going to be able to proceed. So we're, you know, the, in this particular case, and I suspect this will come up, um, as we talk a little bit of meta here, but as we talk through Saudi telecom is, I suspect the one things that will come up is having been in telecom, there's going to be numbers that people rely on like a lot. There's going to be numbers. And one of the things I think will evaluate people is there.
01:40:06 Speaker: ability not only to use the numbers but the the art which is where is there a part of my head that tells me when something's something's off something doesn't feel right i'm not seeing or maybe i'm not seeing a genuine trend something is off in the uh in the analysis and i think that that is a very hard thing to replicate it requires a lot of quantitative skill for someone to have that but it is a
01:40:32 Speaker: qualitative uh assessment yeah that he or she will have to make to figure you know to to push back and say like wait wait hold on a second let's talk about this yeah okay super super helpful then a good thoughtful answer i think we're gonna we've only got a few more minutes and we are gonna spend if it's okay with you we'll spend like a few extra yeah 10 minutes or so to make up for the time i'm here as long as you want okay
01:40:58 Speaker: So we have one more section of this model, which is this idea of being a resilient steward. And it has to do with kind of stepping forward, saying, I'm open to new ideas. My idea isn't always necessarily the best idea. But also being able to inspire others and have the grit and perseverance to move forward when things are tough. And so I'm curious about if you have any additional stories or if you want to point to some of the stories you've already shared.
01:41:27 Speaker: where you feel like you've been able to demonstrate kind of that ability to be open, say, hey, it's not all about me, but then just grit down and be resilient when things get difficult? That is an interesting one. Because part of being able to grit down and identify that things become difficult is determined by whether you recognize that it's difficult. Because there's some people, stubborn people,
01:41:54 Speaker: for whom they will not, like they're unable to see that this is a difficulty. For them, it's head down, go forward. Like I, you know, I get the one aunt who had it very tough when she came to the U.S. She really had a family where she lived and was raising a couple of kids by herself. And if you asked her if she had grit, I don't think she would ever say that. I think she would say I had to do what I had to do. And one of the challenges in answering this question is asking, am I identifying when I've used grit?
01:42:23 Speaker: Applied liberally, chutzpah or grit, resilience, sometimes masks that you had to use resilience at all. Yeah, because you're just letting the... You don't know, because you're like, nah, I'm not taking no for an answer. We're going to get this thing built, right? We're going to get this project done. And so I think one of the things that I'm looking for here, as I call my memory bank, is...
01:42:55 Speaker: All right, I got one. Okay. There is, in Siberia, the way that it worked was on one of the trips to collect tusks, we actually got into an old Soviet helicopter. It was in 2002, so Soviet Union had been long gone. And this old Soviet helicopter, and they toppled us out really far north into the tundra. There's no trees.
01:43:23 Speaker: right it's the only things on there there's no like grassy plants it's just this layer of like short short like bryo warty kind of things you know bryo fatty kind of plants right like it's it's uh uh it's like a moss but like a thicker like it's not moss but like it it's like that right um they're swampy they're like swampy plants um and so you get out there and there's there's not a whole lot there's no shade right because there's no trees yeah and you get dropped off and uh
01:43:53 Speaker: and at the time they dropped us off and i had a bag right or two bags so i could collect the tusks uh and um we had some food with us uh and we had a number of bottles of vodka we ran into any reindeer hunters along the way we could trade you know for other things um and we asked the gent uh who dropped us off one of the guys uh he was like okay three days we come back in three days we come back uh and i was like
01:44:22 Speaker: okay um how will you know where we are right he's like there is nothing just follow the river we'll find you we'll find you just follow the reason so uh and and so seeing the chopper go off i remember thinking at the time like this is this is wild because if i was thinking about this from rationally like we had no satellite phone right we had we had we had a couple of emergency signaling blankets right uh and signals but like in the middle of the tundra like on the other side of the world like
01:44:51 Speaker: if something goes wrong we're toast right like and um but it didn't occur to me at the time that that was the case right because you're you're focused on the job you've got a job to do and you do it so that a little bit to what we were talking about before yeah but here's where the grit part comes in okay there is at the time we were there it was um it's north of the arctic circle so there was no darkness yeah like the sun just went close to the horizon then went back up and so
01:45:20 Speaker: One of the things that you realize, at least I realize it at the time, this is more physical grip than, you know, organizational, was that when you don't have a good place to camp for the night, you don't have an option. You have to keep going because you cannot, you can't camp on the riverbank, right? You can't camp where the ground is uneven or not uneven, but unstable. You just have to keep going.
01:45:50 Speaker: Tundra works is the permafrost melts. The permafrost doesn't melt because it's low enough on the ground which stays frozen all year. That's why it's permafrost. But the ice above it melts in the springtime. And so you get these pools of water. There's a lot of standing stagnant water. And there's a lot of mosquitoes out there, like a ton of mosquitoes. And so you can't bed down in the water, right? And you have to find a place that's relatively dry, elevated enough where it's dry. You can put your tent down and you have to get in the tent.
01:46:19 Speaker: Because when the mosquitoes come out, there's a lot of them. They smell you from miles away. And there is a moment when you are tired. When you are hiking, you're carrying a tusk or two or three. You really would like to stop walking. But you can't. You can't. There's an element there where, as a human being, you have to accept the conclusion, I cannot stop, I have to keep going.
01:46:47 Speaker: There are people in this world, and I'm going to include myself in this, in other situations, where you can't, but you do. The rational part of you would say you can't stop, but the lizard part says I'm tired of the city man. We've all seen people do it. They engage in self-destructive behavior, they give up right before they succeed, like a number of other things. There is a decision you have to make, and you have to make it at some point, which is I am not going to let my frustration, my point,
01:47:17 Speaker: level of frustration impede me from where I'm trying to get to, which is home, right? And I would make it sound a little bit more dramatic than it was, but it is, you know, at three in the morning when you're still walking, looking for a place, you know, to set your tent up, there are thoughts in your head where you can't quite believe that you're still walking. And in an organization, that has to come from
01:47:42 Speaker: a number of different people, not necessarily the person in charge, but there has to be a requisite number of people that say, like, we have to fix this problem. We're not just going to say, well, that's it. I'm going to put in my resume tomorrow because this company is toast. Right. There has to be at least enough people to say that we're going to get through this. We're going to work it. And even if we fail, we're going to fail standing. We're going to go down swinging. And that is that is not.
01:48:11 Speaker: Some people are more naturally attuned to it than others. But in almost all cases, someone has to make a decision and an active decision that I'm not going to stop. Yeah. What a great story on resilience. That would be like a TED Talk right by itself. Is that? Yeah. Look, I already have like the head mic. I'm already halfway there. That was really good. Are you in here? Okay.
01:48:37 Speaker: This is also resilience. This is also an example of resilience. I'll make a move. I'll find out in just a minute. Are you in there? Yeah. Okay, great.
01:49:16 Speaker: we realized we have all this stuff. All right. Find these apartments. Hello. I'm back. You're back. That is funny. I think these students must, there's some reservation system and they, yeah, they need to be in the one they reserved. And so like there are empty ones here. Yeah. It's funny. Well, we were the, but we were the ones who did that at ILAD. Oh yeah. Like we reserved it. Like I'm sure some people were walking by like, that's true. Yeah. All right.
01:49:45 Speaker: We're on to the next thing here. Okay. So I'm going to show the little chart again. And when I do that, I'd love to get your perspective on your own kind of strengths that you have and then areas where for you personally, you're maybe not as strong or it's like, it's not as important. And the example I give is, you know,
01:50:14 Speaker: soccer or football around the world is a pretty popular sport. And one of the things I've seen is that some leaders go to the equivalent of the goalie and they say, hey, what's your problem? You're not scoring goals. Like I've been tracking you for the last two years. Oh, I like that. And you're not scoring any goals. And by the way, what do we do here? How do we win? Well, we score goals and you're not doing any of it. So that's a problem. And I think, I mean, it's kind of a ridiculous analogy, but the point is, is there's some things that,
01:50:43 Speaker: It's true. We need to be good at and other things that maybe aren't as important for our effectiveness. So what I'd love to do is, as I share this example with you, if you can see my slide, let me know when it pulls up for you. Sure, it's loading now. It hasn't quite come up yet. There it is. Okay. As you look at these bullet points, if you were to pick two that you're like, you know what? For me, in my style of leadership, in the role that I have, this is where I'm really strong and where I need to be strong.
01:51:12 Speaker: And then maybe pick two where you say, you know what, this is not as important to me or it's maybe not a strength. So where would you pick the two strengths and the two areas that are not as big a deal? The two strengths, I think, are under resilient steward and talent enabler. Okay. I'm going to push you to the bullet points. So I wasn't clear on that. Oh, the bullet points. Yeah, give me a bullet point. And I apologize, I wasn't clear.
01:51:42 Speaker: yeah no i'll tell you uh let's say uh i'll pick inspire under resilient steward okay and um on a talent enabler i guess either elevate or coach one of the two maybe i'll say elevate okay let's say inspire and elevate for talent enabler um uh and i'll explain why in a minute um and then for places where i need to improve because i think actually all this is important
01:52:09 Speaker: And I think you don't make a sandwich by saying the bread is more important than the meat. It's not really a sandwich unless you have the bread. So I'd say for two that I am not as strong about, but I want to be better. One is innovate in the sense that I would love to have Matt.
01:52:37 Speaker: exercise the mental muscle that it takes to look for novel solutions, novel problems and novel solutions. There's some folks where their brains are naturally scanning or they're making themselves scan for those, and I would like to strengthen that muscle, that mental muscle. One of the things that I think I could be better at is, because I actually enjoy the
01:53:06 Speaker: doing this stuff under agile executor but one thing that i would like to be better at is deliver okay i adapt pretty easily right and um i'm very i'm quite good at marching off you know into the wilderness whenever it's something that needs to be done like i like doing new things even if i'm not necessarily the one who's concocting the plan but i think deliver is uh something i need to work on in large part because it's this deliver
01:53:35 Speaker: This is the vanishing point for all these other items. It's not the most important. That's not the case at all. But what mostly is seen is that point, is the deliver. When people ask what happened this year, sometimes they'll talk about this other stuff. When it gets reduced to a bullet point for the board or for the shareholders, it's going to be right there, deliver.
01:54:02 Speaker: And so that's a place where I would like to be better at identifying what needs to be delivered and really focusing on making sure that that happens. In large part, it's not a zero-sum game that can feel that way because the more time I spend coaching, sometimes it can feel like I'm not delivering as much, which is not true because if you're coaching effectively, you're actually delivering more. The more time you spend trying to simplify the process.
01:54:31 Speaker: Right. That simplification is not being reported at the end of the year. Right. If it results in delivery increases, it will be reported at the end of the year. But if you simplify the process and this year it doesn't deliver, but it will in three years, it's going to require somebody to have to walk through it. So that's one in which deliver I would like to do better at because for some reductive analyses, that is all the people see. Okay. Brilliant.
01:55:01 Speaker: So now tell me about your hopes and dreams for the future. And I know we could spend another two hours. I'm sure this is a topic, but just kind of succinctly, what would you say? What do you what do you hope for in your career in the next three to five years? What do you hope to accomplish and what do you hope to be doing? You know, it's funny because I actually I actually do almost every day. I actually do a review of both my personal mission statement, my personal constitution and my goals list. OK.
01:55:31 Speaker: uh and so i'm i think i'm pretty i don't know if this i'm ready to answer it never feels you know complete but i think like if you talk about my career over the next few years what i'd like to do is three things okay um and it's one of the reasons why i want to get into global development and sustainability so one um is to um you know provide for my family like that's the easy thing like i want i would like to be earning at a reasonable clip whatever that means right but like i'd like to earn
01:56:00 Speaker: as much as is ethically and lifestyle allowed right i don't want to i don't want to not see my kids yeah right like the i really appreciate this the time for this call because my kids i got to help get the kids ready for bed and they got the bed and i come here for it right yeah so i like to reasonably make an income um that still allows me to to be a father and to be a husband um the second is i would like to uh
01:56:30 Speaker: do it in a way where it allows me the constant stimulus of either new people, new clients, new problems. Whether it's my ADHD or other aspects of my personality, I like being able to solve problems. You know, a new problem for a new company or new people. And I need that kind of constant stimulus. There are some people that are very good at doing the same thing over and over and over again. I'm not.
01:56:58 Speaker: one of those i wish i was in some ways but i'm i'm not um for me to be effective at a i need to also be cycling through b and c yeah um and so that's that's part of my effectiveness i mean the third part of my professional career is i would like to make an impact it doesn't have to be the biggest impact i don't have delusions but i'm going to save the world but i would like it that um when the scales are balanced at the end i would like
01:57:25 Speaker: There should be some parts of the scale that says he left the world hopefully a little bit better than he found it. The ancient Egyptians, in their death mythology, believed that at the end of your life, Anubis weighs your heart on a scale against a feather. And if your heart is heavier than a feather, you go down. If your heart is lighter than a feather, you go up.
01:57:55 Speaker: Part of what I'd like is that at the end that I've been less of a weight on my community, on the world, on the people around me, that I have been a reduction of weight. That's beautiful. Very cool.
